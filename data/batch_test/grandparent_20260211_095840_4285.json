Christopher has expressed a sense of responsibility and urgency regarding these matters, which is why we are reaching out directly for assistance with payment.\n\nAs far as documentation goes, I can certainly arrange for an invoice or formal letter that outlines all necessary details once the payment method is confirmed. However, due to the immediate nature of this situation, it would be best if we could proceed with a wire transfer to secure the release of all documents and prevent any legal issues from arising.\n\nI understand your need for thorough verification and am more than willing to provide further evidence as required by your family's protocols.
