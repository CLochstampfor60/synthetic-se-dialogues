We have a young adult by the name of Emily Thompson here and we need to secure her release on bail due to a DUI arrest. Your wife's contact information was found in Emily's wallet along with yours. Could you please assist us or connect us with your spouse? This is quite urgent as we need someone from the family to come down and post the bond immediately to avoid any additional charges. The amount right now is $9,500 but it can be reduced if posted soon. Can you help me reach your wife, sir?",

What kind of trouble could our little girl be in?\"]\n\nOh no, I don't know much yet either. The caller says something about a DUI and needs us to come put up bail money or something like that. He's asking if we can send the $9,500 right away.\n\n[Wife: \"That's a lot of money... What should we do?\"]\n\nI think it might be a scam, but I'm not sure. I'll ask him more questions and see what he says.\n\n[Back to caller]\n\nOfficer Johnson, if this is really about Emily, can you confirm her address or the date she was last seen with her friends? Something specific that would prove you know who she is and how long she's been away from home?\n\nIf it's a real emergency, we need time to figure out what to do. We don't want to rush into anything without being sure.\n \nPlease hold on while I talk this over further with my wife.",

To help confirm Emily's identity, could you please provide her date of birth or any recent activities she was involved in that we might have noted while processing her? It's essential for us to establish that this is indeed about your granddaughter.\n\nAs far as the bail amount goes, if it's not convenient to bring cash immediately, do either of you have access to a wired transfer service like Western Union? This would allow us to expedite the release process. We are here to assist in any way possible and ensure she gets home safely without unnecessary complications or costs.\n\nPlease let me know how I can proceed with this matter as soon as you've had a chance to discuss it further with your wife, okay?\n\nThank you for your cooperation and understanding during this stressful time.",

We need to go see for ourselves and verify everything.\n\nOfficer Johnson, this situation needs more verification from our end. Can you direct us to a verified contact number or an office address we can reach out directly to confirm details?\n\nWe'll be in touch shortly after checking all these points with official channels.\n \nThank you for your understanding now; let's make sure there are no misunderstandings before taking any action.",
