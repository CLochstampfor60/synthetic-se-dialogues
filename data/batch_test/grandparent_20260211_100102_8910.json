They say I got a DUI, but please don't worry about that part. Right now, I just need to pay the bail or they'll hold me here longer! The officer says it's $8500, but if you can get even half of that, they might let me go with less. Can you send someone with cash right away? It's such an emergency...

That might be enough to get me out on a lower bail or at least keep them from holding onto my car longer. Please hurry, I'm so scared and stressed here. Just tell anyone who comes that it's an emergency fee for release and not a bribe. It will all work out if you can help me fast.",
