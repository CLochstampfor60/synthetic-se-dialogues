The officer said they want $8500 for my bail but if we can pay more of it now, maybe I won't have to wait as long in jail until court. Please don't send cash though; just come by and bring the money if that's okay? I'll be right here where you drop off the cash so I can get out quicker. Can you do that for me grandma?",

Just please hurry grandma, this isn't funny anymore and I'm really scared.",

It's really important that they know exactly where to go and how to handle this properly at the desk. If no one else is available, maybe we could find a place nearby I can meet up with once some of it has been posted so I'm out sooner rather than later.
