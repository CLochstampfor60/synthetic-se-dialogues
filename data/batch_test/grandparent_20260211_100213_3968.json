They will require a confirmation number which I can provide once we start the process here. Could you also have Michael's full name, his date of birth, and possibly any other identifying information handy so we can verify it's him? Once that is all squared away, the money should be available for pick-up very shortly after transfer. Let me know when you are ready to proceed with this step, okay?",
