I was in a car accident and the police said it's my fault because I wasn't paying attention to the road. Now the hospital is asking for lots of money and they won't release me until everything is sorted out. They say I have to pay $6,000 right away but I don't have that kind of cash on hand. I'm so scared, Grandma. Can you please help me? It's really important that this stays between us because Mom might get mad at me for causing an accident and Dad is traveling out of the country with no phone service. Please, can you buy me some gift cards and send them over to the hospital?",

Don't you worry one bit about anything; just concentrate on getting better, okay sweetie?",

Right now, the hospital is saying I at least need to pay $2,500 before they'll let me have any visitors or give me more information about my condition beyond what's on file already. It's really scary here without anyone except for strangers and doctors who aren't letting me see anyone from home yet. Please hurry though; can you get some Best Buy gift cards right now? They accept those here at the hospital emergency room where I am. And oh, please don't tell Mom just yet - she's been under a lot of stress as it is with work and everything. Just come straight to Bayview Hospital on Main Street; they'll let me out soon once this payment goes through.",

Please hurry when you can, even if it's late or inconvenient for you. I'll stay on the phone with you until help arrives so they know I'm waiting. Thank you again, Grandma - you're a lifesaver!",
