However, due to the sensitive nature of Tyler's situation, we need immediate action to avoid any legal complications that could arise if delays occur in handling the necessary paperwork and payments associated with his accident. The courthouse does not have an open line for such urgent matters; it's standard protocol to handle these situations directly over the phone under supervision by senior officers to expedite processes. \n\nIf you would like, I can put you on speaker with another officer who can verify my identity and ensure that everything Tyler needs is covered as swiftly as possible. This will also give us a chance to go through all the necessary steps right away. Please let me know your preference so we can move forward quickly for Tyler's benefit.",

Please contact them right away and ask for Officer Jane Foster; she's informed about Tyler's case and will be able to guide us through the next steps accurately.
