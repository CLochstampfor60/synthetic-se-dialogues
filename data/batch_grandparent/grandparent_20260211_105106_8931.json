It's all so confusing and scary here at the hospital... Can you believe it? Dad isn't answering his phone right now and Mom is out of town. They'll be furious when they find out but I need help with something really important. Could you please come up with some money for the damages and to cover my legal fees? It's urgent, Grandpa.",

This place isn't letting me leave unless they see proof that we're handling things on our end.

That way, we make sure that whatever help I send is exactly what's needed and safe for both of us. If you're really stuck now with fees or damage costs, maybe there are other solutions they could explain if your grandpa calls them. Stay calm sweetie, everything will be alright.",
