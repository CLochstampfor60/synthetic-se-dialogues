We've already contacted a few other individuals Sarah listed as contacts, but they weren't available when she needed them urgently.\n\nAs for speaking directly with Sarah, I understand your concern and would like to reassure you she is safe and being well cared for until this matter is resolved. However, the nature of her situation right now means direct communication isn't possible to protect privacy laws and regulations set forth by our facility. We can arrange a call tomorrow when things have settled down regarding visitation rights if needed.\n\nPlease proceed with the payment at your earliest convenience so we can get Sarah out as soon as possible. Can you bring the cash over or will it be easier for you to send via courier service? Let me know how you plan on handling this matter now, Harold.\n",

I'll call someone right now to check on this situation first, okay?\n\nPlease give me time to double-check everything and speak with other family members before making any decisions about sending money or transferring it anywhere. This seems wrong somehow, and I want to make sure I'm not getting tricked into doing something dangerous for my granddaughter.\n\r\r\nThank you for your understanding here; I just need a moment to ensure Sarah is really in trouble and needs this help from me.",

Your prompt action could significantly ease her current predicament.\n\nPlease proceed at your discretion but do so quickly since the process must adhere strictly to deadlines and protocols set by our facility.
