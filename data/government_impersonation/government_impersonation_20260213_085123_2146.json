If you call them yourself, it may be too late by then to protect your benefits due to the system changes. To verify who I am quickly since you're worried about security, can you buy a $1200 gift card from a major retailer and read back the number here?

But due to security reasons, we need to do this quick verification step of a gift card to protect your information better against scams like these which are unfortunately common nowadays. Please trust me, it's just for safety measures to prevent any wrongful actions towards you today specifically. Let's make sure everything stays secure and intact for your benefits.
