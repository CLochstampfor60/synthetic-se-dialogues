They say your Social Security Number has been compromised and they're going to stop sending payments until you verify your identity by buying a few gift cards for them - it's just for security reasons. Don't worry about the money; you'll get it back once everything is sorted out. But we have to do this today, end of day. Can you go to the store right now and buy some $1200 worth of Visa Gift Cards? The cashier will help you activate them so I can send over a link for you to enter the card numbers and security codes here on my end. It's urgent or they'll stop your benefits.",

Okay, okay. Where can I find the nearest store that has those gift cards? And would you mind walking me through this step-by-step over the phone while Mom helps me too? We'll make sure not to rush or anything as long as it gets sorted today.",

I'll guide you every step of the way. Once you've got the cards, we'll activate them together and then follow the instructions to submit the codes. Let's make sure to get this done today before anything else happens. Don't worry, it's quick once you're there.
