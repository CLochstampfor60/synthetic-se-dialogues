There's been some unusual activity in your account; I'm afraid someone might have gotten access to your information. This is really important and needs immediate attention.

The person who compromised your information could be accessing benefits right now, and we need to act fast before it's too late. Listen carefully: To secure your account, you need to verify your identity with a payment of $1200 using gift cards or prepaid debit cards. This will prove that it's still just you managing your Social Security benefits and not someone else. Once I confirm the funds from these cards are in place, your access will be reinstated right away. Can we do this today? It has to happen before end of day.",

Please trust me on this; if we don't act now, there's a real risk of losing access to your benefits permanently. Can you proceed with purchasing the gift cards today?
