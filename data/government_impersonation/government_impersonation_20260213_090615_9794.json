We're here to help secure your account right now - if we call you back with a secure line, that might actually take longer than what's available today.\nPlease trust me and follow these steps:\n1. Buy two $600 Walmart gift cards.\n2. Call the customer service number on the back of each card and give us both phone numbers.\n3. We'll verify your identity through these transactions to ensure everything is secure and working correctly for you, Grandpa Walter.\nIf we don't receive this confirmation before end of day today, all benefits will be placed on hold until further notice. This action is necessary to protect your account from fraudulent activities. Please hurry but be cautious - use a reliable store like Walmart or CVS for these purchases.\nCan I guide you through this process now? It's vital we complete it within the next few hours before any irreversible actions are taken against your benefits.",

We need to make absolutely certain before we do anything else, okay? Please just give me a moment to call them myself so I know it's really you and not someone trying to take advantage of an older person like me.\nCan you hold on while my wife helps me look up the right number and check this out properly?
