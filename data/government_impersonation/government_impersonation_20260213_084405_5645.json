Should we listen?\n(After spouse's response)\nAgent Mitchell, my wife is here now. Can you please provide me with your employee number or some other way to verify this call? We're not sure if this is really from the IRS.\nAlso, can I check this out on their website instead of over the phone? The last time someone called about taxes, it turned out to be a mistake.\n(I'll hang up for now and look you up online. If you're real, we'll call back using information we get from your official site.)",
