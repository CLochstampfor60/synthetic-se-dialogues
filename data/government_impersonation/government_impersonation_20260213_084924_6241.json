Look, Grandpa, there's been an issue with the IRS regarding some unpaid taxes from back in 2019. They're saying if this isn't resolved right away, they'll show up at your door within the hour to take you into custody for not paying them.\nI really need you to stay on the line so we can figure out how to fix this today before it gets any worse. We should have sent a letter or given you a call earlier but things got hectic here and now there's a real risk of immediate consequences if anything isn't done quickly.\nHow do you feel about that? Are you able to handle this right now, Grandpa?",

She'll know what we should do next.\n(Hangs up briefly)\nMy wife says she hasn't heard from any official government entity regarding unpaid taxes or anything like that. We're pretty careful about these kinds of issues and try to handle them promptly. But if you say it's really urgent, maybe I need to speak with someone at the IRS myself directly, not just over this phone call.\nCould you provide me a number for an actual office of the Internal Revenue Service so I can confirm all this information? This seems very serious and I want to make sure we deal with it properly.\nAlso, my wife mentioned that our accountant usually handles these matters. Maybe we should contact him instead since he's more familiar with our financial situation.\nCan you give me a moment to do that while you hold or shall we hang up now?",
