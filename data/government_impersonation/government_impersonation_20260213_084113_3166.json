Can you confirm your full name and date of birth so I can verify it's really you on the line? And just between us, we're working hard to prevent any misuse of your Social Security benefits right now. Trust me, this is super important, especially given today's threat landscape.",

Then, based on our assessment, if further action is needed, such as suspending benefits temporarily until we can ensure everything is secure, we'll provide specific instructions through official channels like a personal visit or a call back using their main number. But since we're dealing with potential fraud here, the faster we act, the better we protect your funds. That's why I'm calling today. If you want to proceed cautiously, we can certainly arrange for an in-person meeting or another verification method through our official channels. Just let me know how you'd like to move forward and I'll make it happen right away.",

If it makes you more comfortable, we can also schedule an appointment at your local Social Security office after confirming your identity through a secure call or visit. I want to make sure everything is clear and that there are no misunderstandings here. Please take this seriously though; the quicker we address any potential issues, the safer your benefits will remain. Call us back at that number when you're ready, okay?",
