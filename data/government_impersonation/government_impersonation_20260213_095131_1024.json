You have a serious violation that needs immediate attention or there will be consequences including immediate arrest and legal action. Can you confirm this is Mr. Walter?",

My wife helps me manage everything very carefully.\nI'm a bit confused though, because usually the IRS sends letters first before calling... right?\nAnd why would you be using a phone number that isn't from Washington D.C.? That seems odd to me.",

We are making direct calls like this one for cases with immediate risk. Your account has been flagged multiple times over the past year, and I need you to take action now to resolve it before further steps are taken against you. As for the phone number, we use secure lines from various locations for these urgent communications.\nNow, regarding your tax situation, according to our records, there is a significant amount outstanding that needs immediate resolution to avoid arrest. The fine is $4850 which must be paid within the hour or else I will dispatch a team to take you into custody and process legal charges against you. We accept Walmart gift cards as payment at this time.\nDo you understand what's required, Mr. Walter? Can we proceed with getting this resolved right away?",

My wife and I always file our taxes on schedule and usually don't owe anything beyond what's automatically taken out through payroll.\nI think it would be wise for me to speak with my wife first about this. She handles most of the financial matters and will know better than anyone whether we actually have unpaid taxes or not. Can you give us some time to verify this information?\nAlso, I'm really worried about giving out any payment details over the phone-it just doesn't feel right.\nCould you hold on a moment while I check with her?",

However, under our current directives, immediate compliance is mandatory or legal action will proceed without further delay. You have the option to arrange for someone trusted like your wife to come here today to pay in person if that feels more secure.\nBut we require assurance now that this issue will be addressed swiftly as required by law. Payment must still occur within the hour through approved methods or the consequences escalate dramatically. Please let me know how quickly you can settle this so I can guide you accordingly.\nIs there anyone nearby you could contact who might assist in handling this urgently, Mr. Walter? Time is extremely limited here and we need to avoid any unnecessary penalties or actions against you.\nCan your wife call back shortly with confirmation of the payment details? We're waiting for resolution now, please act quickly.",

But if you're from the IRS, shouldn't you give us some time to sort things out rather than demanding payment in such a short timeframe? It feels like something isn't quite right here, but I want to make sure before we do anything.\nI'll pass this call over to her now and we'll get back to you shortly with more details.

I urge you both to prioritize resolving this urgently and contact us promptly.\nThank you for your understanding, Mr. Walter. We're here to help ensure compliance and prevent any unnecessary legal actions against you or your family. Please have your wife call back at her earliest convenience.",
