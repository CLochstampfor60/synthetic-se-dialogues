Remember, we had a chat last week when they called in distress and asked if you could send money to an address for safety reasons? This is kind of like that but much more serious.\nI need your help right away because something really bad has happened. Someone stole my identity and used it to get benefits under your name. They even tried to use a fake Social Security card with your details on it! Now the SSA says you might lose your benefits if we don't sort this out fast.\nThey told me I should contact you, but now they won't let me talk to them anymore unless you verify that it's really me making this call. Otherwise, my grandma and grandpa's Social Security benefits might be suspended until further notice! Can you imagine what would happen then?\nI really need you to prove it's me by buying a few hundred dollars' worth of prepaid cards and giving the numbers here so I can show they're mine. Believe me, Grandpa, this is the only way forward or else there could be serious consequences for everyone's benefits!\nPlease hurry, we have until the end of today to resolve this issue before your account gets shut down. It's a nightmare scenario you don't want to face. You've got to help out here!",

This sounds really serious, but I just want to make sure it's not something... tricky or illegal, you know? We'll call back later after we've had a chance to sort through our papers and figure out what's going on.\nCan you give me your number so if we need anything else from you for verification purposes down the line?\nActually, maybe I should go check with her right now. She might have more ideas about how to handle this properly without rushing into anything rash or unsafe. We'll get back in touch shortly and see what she says.\nOkay, bye for now and thank you for calling me on this.",
