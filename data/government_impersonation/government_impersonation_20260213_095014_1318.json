Can we proceed and make sure everything is okay? Please tell me what to do next so that the authorities don't come after either of you.",

Could you give us your number so we can call back later when we've had time to look into this properly?",

The officer said it has to be taken care of today or else there'll be immediate arrest once they find out where you are. Please don't delay any longer - we need to resolve this quickly by getting the gift cards as instructed. Can I at least tell you how to do that safely? We can use prepaid Visa cards from your local store, and all you have to do is provide the card numbers over the phone here so they know it's taken care of. It only takes a few minutes and saves both of us a lot of trouble in the long run. Please let's act now before anything else happens.",

We need more information and assurance that what you're telling us is accurate. It wouldn't be safe for us to just hand over money or card details without verifying it first.\nCan we please end the call here? Thank you for your understanding, and stay safe.",
