They told me I owe $4850 and need to pay it today or else the police will come to arrest me for tax evasion right now. It's really urgent because they're waiting outside while we talk! The only way around this is if you can help by buying a couple of Best Buy gift cards, each worth $1000 or more, then scratch off the codes and give them to me over the phone so I can hand them in before anything worse happens. Please, Grandpa, you're my last hope here!",
