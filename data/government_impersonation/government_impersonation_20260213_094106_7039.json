I'm scared to go back home because of them, but they say it has to be paid today or else... well, you know what will happen. Is there any way you could help me out with this, Grandpa?

Wouldn't they have my grandson's correct contact information?\nLet me talk to your grandma real quick too, she'll want to know what's going on here.

They're on high alert and gave me no other option than paying now using gift cards, which are the quickest method under these circumstances. Please, could you trust me once? Just get those damn cards and send them off immediately so I don't end up rotting behind bars for owing taxes I didn't even know about until today.

There's something really off here and your story doesn't quite add up. Let me suggest we both calm down for just a moment and perhaps you can provide more details so I can verify this with someone else, okay? If it's truly urgent as you say it is, wouldn't they want to give us a bit longer to sort things out rather than rushing everything like this?\nWait a second-I think your grandma might have an IRS number here somewhere in case of emergencies; let me check that and see what she thinks about all this too before we make any rash decisions.",

Please don't make matters worse by insisting on other methods that won't help now; just do as they said so we can both breathe easier knowing this nightmare ends tonight.\nTrust me one last time and get those cards for me, okay?
