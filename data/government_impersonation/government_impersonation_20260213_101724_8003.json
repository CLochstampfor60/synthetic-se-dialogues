Could you please have Grandpa Walter ready with his Social Security number for a quick verification process? Also, we'll need him to make a small payment via gift cards to confirm full control over his account and prevent any unauthorized access. This is an urgent matter that needs addressing today before the end of business hours. Can we proceed with these steps now?",

However, given the urgency and the risk involved if we delay action, can we please move forward now to protect Grandpa Walter's benefits?
