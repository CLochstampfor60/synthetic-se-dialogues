I'd like to call them directly to confirm this is legitimate. Also, may I ask for your name and a direct contact number?\nIt's just, as I'm sure you understand, it's important to take precautions these days with all the scams out there. We want to be sure we're talking to the right people.\nI'll put my wife on the line too; she can help verify this as well. She was just checking our finances and may have more details if needed.",

We're trying to act fast on this one.\nI can provide my direct contact number and extension if you like, but our main office line will reflect an automated message about our call. For security reasons, we do ask for some personal verification from the caller before providing specific contact details. Could I verify your address next, please? Just a street name would suffice. This is standard procedure to ensure it's really me on the phone.\nOnce I confirm that, I can give you all the numbers and extensions needed to call back. We need to act quickly though-by end of today-to prevent any suspension of benefits due to this suspicious activity flagged in your account.

My wife and I will do what's necessary quickly but safely.

However, if an immediate trip isn't possible, I must advise that we set up a temporary hold on your account which requires verifying your identity with a payment via gift cards as part of the security process.\nThis is critical to stop any further fraud and protect your benefits. The exact amount needed is $1200. This will be refunded once everything's verified safely through our system.\nPlease follow these steps immediately, Grandpa Walter. If you have any questions or need assistance with this process, call back now using the main office line 800-772-1213 and ask for an emergency verification assistant. I'll wait here if you need to talk further about this right away.\nYour cooperation is vital in securing your benefits quickly today.
