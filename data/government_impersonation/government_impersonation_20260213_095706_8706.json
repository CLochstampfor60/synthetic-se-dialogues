If we don't resolve this immediately, there will be an immediate arrest warrant issued for your arrest within the hour.\nListen carefully. There's a way to clear this up right now by purchasing a series of gift cards that total exactly $4850 and giving me the numbers over the phone so I can validate them quickly. That'll stop everything and keep you out of jail.\nDo you understand what needs to happen? You only have 30 minutes left before our officers are dispatched to your address.",

If you're unsure or need to check with your spouse, then I suggest doing it quickly because after these 30 minutes are up, there's no reversing this situation.\nAre you going to resolve this now or do we need to proceed further?\nIf you decide to go ahead, I'll walk you through exactly how to buy the cards and provide the validation codes.

I'll take care of it properly, just not right now over the phone.\nLet's end here, we need time to think this through properly.",
