To avoid this, what I recommend is that you purchase four $300 Walmart gift cards-totaling $1200-to cover our verification process. Once we receive confirmation from you about these purchases, we'll immediately send over the necessary paperwork to confirm everything is in order, and your benefits will remain secure. It's a quick and safe way to ensure all is well.\nPlease hurry, as time is running out for us to complete this today. Can you do that now so we can protect your information?",

Let me talk to her again before we do anything further-maybe there's another way for you to send us some official info about the process?
