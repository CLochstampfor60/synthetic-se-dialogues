The IRS called me about some unpaid taxes from a few years back, and they're threatening to arrest me if I don't settle this today. They gave me until the end of the day to pay it or elseWell, you know how serious that can be with them.\nI was wondering if there's any way you could help me out here? If you could just buy a couple of gift cards and give me the numbers over the phone, I could use that money to settle this with the IRS. It's $4850 total. Can you do that for me?\nPlease hurry though, Grandpa. The clock is ticking!",

ButI haven't had much extra money lying around lately with everything costing so much. What should we do? Maybe there's another way to handle this without needing such a large sum right now. Can't they give you more time or take an installment plan? Your grandmother and I will figure something out, though. Let me talk to her first before doing anything else.",

They won't accept any payment plans right now because of some new regulations they put in place recently for quicker collection of overdue taxes. If I can't resolve this today, there will be serious consequences not just later but even during my call.\nPlease understand that buying these gift cards and sending the codes is really the quickest way to handle it properly. It would mean so much to me if you could help out by doing this right away with whatever you have handy-it doesn't need to be all $4850. Even a partial amount would buy some time while I figure things out further.\nIs there any chance at all you might be able to get started on that, Grandpa? Even just one gift card could make a difference and give me a little breathing room.\nCan we do this quickly before the clock runs out? Please let me know what you can manage.",

The IRS won't budge on this and they warned me that if I don't act fast now, there could be immediate consequences like an arrest warrant being issued today itself.\nCould you at least consider just buying one gift card for whatever amount you feel comfortable with right now? It doesn't have to solve everything all at once; but it does buy time until we can look into other options more thoroughly. Please understand the urgency and try your best to get something done quickly, even if small.\nCan you manage that, Grandpa?
