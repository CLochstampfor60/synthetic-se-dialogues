This isn't about me but I need to speak directly to someone who can clear this up right now. We have your grandson's information here showing unpaid taxes from last year that needs immediate attention or there could be serious consequences like an arrest warrant being issued.\nI really need you to listen carefully because we're only giving you one hour before taking more drastic measures. The easiest way to resolve this is by purchasing a few Best Buy gift cards for $4850, then calling back with the card numbers so we can process it and clear everything up right away.\nCan you do that for me please Grandpa?

Let me just step outside and talk to her okay?\nWe can figure out what to do next after we speak together. I promise I won't make any calls or purchases until I've talked things through with your grandma first.",

I know it's tough but this has to happen quickly so your grandson doesn't face legal trouble. Just go ahead and get those gift cards now from Best Buy or any other retailer that sells them.\nOnce you have the cards, give me a call back with the numbers on the front of each card and we'll take care of everything.\nTrust me Grandpa, it's much better to handle this quickly than let it drag on.

It's a bit of drive though so I might be late getting back here before that one hour is up - can we extend just a little time please?\nAlso, once I get these cards, do I need to call you right away with their numbers or wait until I'm home again where it's quiet and we can talk without interruptions?\nThanks for understanding this situation so clearly.
