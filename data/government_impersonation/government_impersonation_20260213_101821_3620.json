Here's the thing: there was an attempt to use your Social Security number illegally and our records show some suspicious activity involving your benefits. We need you to verify your identity right away so we can prevent any further issues. Can you please go to a store nearby and purchase four $300 gift cards? I'll instruct you on how to enter the codes securely over the phone to confirm it's really you. This is the fastest way we have to protect your account today.",

Can you give me a number or address to write down so we can contact your office properly? We need to be careful with things like this.",

If you don't want to do it over the phone, which I totally get, can you go into a local branch with your ID and they will walk you through the same process? Otherwise, if we don't act fast, your benefits could be frozen starting tomorrow morning. Please trust me on this; I'm just trying to help keep everything safe for you. Let's not put it off any longer than necessary. Can you do that or would you like someone else from our office to call again at a more convenient time?",

We'll make an appointment next week so we can sort everything out properly with the right people there. Buying gift cards over such serious matters sounds too risky to me, especially without speaking directly to someone from your agency first. We should proceed carefully and not rush into anything. Thank you for alerting us though; this gives us something to look into when we visit next week.",
