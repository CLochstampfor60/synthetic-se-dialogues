I understand this might seem overwhelming, but following the law means there are no exceptions or delays allowed. We need to rectify this immediately by purchasing a specific amount in gift cards as payment. Can you do that for me? The instructions are simple and will clear your name right away.",

My wife usually deals with taxes, and if there's an issue like this, she would have told me directly instead of you calling in like this.\nI'm going to hang up now and talk to her about your call, because something doesn't feel right. We'll figure out what we need to do together once she gets home from running errands. It's just that IRS calls seem more formal than this and usually involve paperwork or letters first, not just a phone call asking for gift cards.\nThank you for reaching out though, I appreciate your concern but it seems like there might be some mistake here. If it's really about taxes, my wife will know how to handle it properly.",
