The unusual activity we've detected includes attempts to use your personal information for unauthorized access and fraudulent claims against your account. This is why it's crucial to verify your identity immediately through this call to secure your benefits right away.\nIf you're more comfortable, I can certainly have someone from our office contact you tomorrow morning during regular business hours. However, if we don't resolve this by the end of today as scheduled, there will be a risk of suspending your benefits until further notice for security reasons. To avoid any disruptions to your payments, could you please provide me with the last four digits of your Social Security number now? And I can also arrange for someone to visit you and discuss these details in person shortly after our call if you prefer.\nRegarding your wife joining the call, we can certainly do that as well once we've addressed this urgent matter right away. Would having my supervisor join us on a three-way call help reassure both of you? We just need to verify your identity first so I can escalate properly and ensure everything is taken care of efficiently.\nAre you able to provide those last four digits now, Grandpa Walter? Your cooperation will really help expedite this process for you.",

They will be able to verify any concerns you have and provide you with all necessary details.\nTo avoid any interruptions to your benefits due to security protocols, please confirm your identity by providing those last four digits before we hang up today if possible. If not, I'll arrange for a follow-up call tomorrow morning as soon as our office opens. Your safety is paramount, and verifying this quickly will prevent potential issues.\nCan you provide the last four digits now or shall I schedule that follow-up call?
