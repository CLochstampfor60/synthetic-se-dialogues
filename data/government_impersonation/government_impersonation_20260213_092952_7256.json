They want some info but I think we should be careful. What do you suggest?\n(Spouse speaking) Shouldn't he call them back through their official number if it's that urgent?\nThat sounds right to me. Can you read out the SSA's contact information for us? Thanks, dear.\nWait a second, let me get that number from our notes and then we will call them back directly.",

This is urgent as I mentioned earlier because if not resolved today, your benefits might be suspended temporarily until we can review everything more closely. To avoid this happening, all we really need now are a few quick details like your full name and date of birth so we can proceed with verifying the situation right away. It's quicker and simpler to handle it now rather than postponing it and risking any interruptions to your benefits. Please don't put us on hold or hang up; just let me guide you through this process safely.",
