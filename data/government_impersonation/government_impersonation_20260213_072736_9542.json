After several attempts last year, we're now looking at legal action if the issue isn't resolved immediately.\nWe have a warrant out for your arrest and there's going to be a federal marshal sent to your home in the next hour unless you can prove that your taxes are paid.\nThis is one of those extremely serious situations where you need to resolve this right away. The fine due today totals $4850, which must be settled immediately by purchasing gift cards from major retailers like Walmart or Best Buy. Once done, call me back with the card numbers and PINs so I can clear your name.\nCan you get that taken care of within the hour? Your granddaughter's safety could depend on it too if we have to send a marshal out.",
