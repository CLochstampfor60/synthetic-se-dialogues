But this isn't something that can wait; they said today or never essentially. And since you've always taught me to handle things responsibly and quickly, I thought you might have a way to help me sort this out without letting things escalate. Could you maybe send the money for my fines using gift cards? It's a bit of an odd request but it's what they're asking for right now.",

But you know, my finances are pretty tight these days. Your grandma and I live on a fixed income, so we don't have much extra to spare. Maybe there's another way to handle this though? Can't you talk to someone else at the IRS about your options? They might be able to help figure out what really needs to happen without needing a large payment right away.",

It's just too urgent for them to be flexible at all. But don't worry about using your own money; perhaps you could give me some advice instead? Maybe there are other resources we can look into together that won't put a strain on our finances. I really appreciate your concern and support, truly.",

In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll figure something out together.",

We'll figure out a way forward that doesn't cause any trouble at all. Let's stay in touch and see what we find, okay?",
