Can you hear me clearly? Also, can you confirm your full name and your date of birth so that we can proceed with securing your account today?\nDon't worry; this is just a routine check-up to make sure everything stays safe and secure for you. We take these things very seriously here at Social Security.",

There have been some attempts to access your personal information and we need you to verify your identity immediately so that we can stop any potential fraud.\nTo do this, we'll need you to purchase a $1200 gift card from Best Buy or Walmart, which will serve as an emergency response measure for us to confirm your current financial status. This is not a charge but rather a way to prove who you are and protect your benefits.\nPlease head out right away if possible and come back with the card number when you're ready. We'll be ending our session at midnight tonight, so please hurry. Your cooperation today will help prevent any further issues down the line. Are you able to handle this urgently?",

She's around here somewhere, let me see if I can find her.\nHoney? Honey! Can you come over here for a moment, dear? There's something important on the phone we need to discuss together.",

We understand it may seem unusual but it's a necessary step in these circumstances.\nCan you confirm if your wife can join the line or should I guide both of you through this process together? Time is running out, so we need to act fast to prevent any suspensions or further complications with your Social Security benefits. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.",

Right now, we just need some time to think about this. Thank you for your understanding.\n What do you think, dear? Should we continue with this or should we hang up and look into it more?\nThat was a bit strange, wasn't it? Let's see what John says when he calls later. For now, I think we should be careful and not rush into anything like that.",
