First, I'll need you to verify some personal information just to confirm it's really you on the line. Can you please tell me the last four digits of your Social Security number?

That's why it's crucial to act fast and secure your information today since Monday might be too late as scammers could potentially cause more damage over the weekend. What I suggest we do right away is set up a verification process through our secure system. All you need to do is purchase a few gift cards with a specific amount on them, which will allow us to complete this identity check and protect your benefits from being suspended. You can visit any store that sells Visa or Mastercard gift cards, buy four $300 ones, totaling $1200. Once you have those numbers ready, I'll guide you through the final steps here on the line. This is the safest way to proceed right now. Please hurry as we need to finish before 4 PM today.",
