If you don't resolve this immediately, federal marshals will be dispatched to make an arrest.\nThe fine owed is $4850, and it needs settling right now before we send enforcement. To clear up the issue, purchase five $1000 Best Buy gift cards and two $450 Amazon gift cards.\nProvide the card numbers and PINs over this line to finalize your payment. Once verified, you'll be cleared of all charges.\nHurry-only one hour remains before legal action is taken against you.",
