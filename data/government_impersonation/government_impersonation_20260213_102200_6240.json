Your grandson here! Don't hang up on me now. We really need to resolve this quickly before anything bad happens.",

We've always been careful about these things. If it's really your idea of a joke, please stop now because you're scaring us. Maybe my hearing isn't what it used to be, but I'm pretty sure this isn't him at all. You should leave us alone and not call again. My wife is getting worried too. We'll talk later if there's nothing serious happening, okay?",

The IRS says they have to see payment for the tax debt within an hour or elseThey're waiting for me on my end and I don't know how much longer I can stall them off before going back there myself where they'll put me under arrest if you don't help out right now. Please, just give me some Walmart gift cards to cover it until we sort this out officially later okay? Just buy a few cards for $4850 total and send the numbers here to me fast so I can pay them off quick before everything blows up in our faces! We're running out of time here, Grandpa. Please hurry, or else everyone will be in trouble including you too if we miss this window.",

Let's talk about this tomorrow when I can think more clearly and maybe my son can join us for a better conversation. Right now, I should probably just hang up so we both stay out of trouble. It doesn't feel right asking someone like you to help with such an urgent payment over the phone like that. We'll figure it out properly later, okay? Please don't call back tonight-it's getting late and my wife is already anxious. Goodnight.",
