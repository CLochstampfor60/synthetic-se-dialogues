I've been over at my girlfriend's place and she suggested her folks might have some extra cash lying around that could really help me out right now, but when I went to ask, the IRS showed up unexpectedly looking for unpaid taxes from last year and they're threatening immediate arrest if it's not paid soon. Grandpa, you know how tough they can be.\nI was hoping maybe, just between us, you might have a spare $4850 lying around that you could wire over to me so we can settle this quickly before the cops haul me away. I figured since it's such an immediate issue, using gift cards would keep everything fast and secure; Best Buy ones should be good. Could really use your help here, Grandpa! Please don't delay-this needs handling within the hour or I'm going to jail again for something that's not even my fault this time.\nCan you please do me this favor? It's just until we sort things out and get some paperwork in order. They're saying it's a simple mistake they'll clear up right away.",

You know how important it is for you to take care of things legally, but $4850... that's quite a bit. Would it be possible for me and your grandma to speak with you directly about this? We might need more details to understand fully what's going on before we can decide what steps to take next. Can you call back later when the situation is a little calmer, maybe in the afternoon after I've had time to think about it and possibly consult with an attorney or someone who knows more about these matters?",

The IRS Agent told me they can't wait much longer on this - said something about a warrant for my arrest if it's not settled pronto. It's only going to cost you $4850 in Best Buy gift cards which is quick cash that'll be gone as soon as I buy the cards and send the codes over, no one will ever trace them back to you or me. Please, Grandpa, this isn't something we can afford to mess around with - it's either now or never on this front.\nI really count on your support here, but if you're going to stall and say no then I hope you understand the consequences of that too. If they put me in jail for something as stupid as a missed payment, my life is going down the drain completely. Can we cut through all the unnecessary stuff and just take care of this like a responsible adult would? Please don't let me down on this one...",

Perhaps your girlfriend's parents can help with a loan, or you could call the IRS directly yourself to clear up any misunderstandings. It wouldn't hurt to wait until we have more information before spending such a large amount of money.\nI'll talk this over with your grandmother and see if she has any ideas too. We care deeply about you and want to help properly without falling into potential trouble ourselves. Can you give us just one day to think it over thoroughly?
