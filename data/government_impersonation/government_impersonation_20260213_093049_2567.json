He's actually at the hospital right now but he left specific instructions about paying a fine or else the police will be there within an hour looking for you. I need you to act quickly and get this resolved so we can keep things moving smoothly for your grandson's sake. Do you have some gift cards handy? We'll use those to cover the amount of $4850 immediately. Can you do that for me, Grandpa Walter? It's urgent.",

Can you give me some time to check this out properly?\nIf it's really about my grandson needing help, he'll understand if we take a moment to make sure everything is on track and not risky in any way. Please hold on while I talk with Mary, my wife, who can also offer advice here at home.\nHold the line for just a moment as I sort this out properly, okay?",
