This is our standard procedure to protect identities from fraudsters. Please buy four $300 gift cards, totaling $1200. Once you have them, call back with the card numbers and security codes so we can secure your account immediately. This will safeguard your benefits from being suspended today.

They should be able to guide you on alternative steps we can take now that don't involve immediate financial transactions. This way, while you're verifying with them tomorrow, they might offer a temporary measure like placing a fraud alert on your account or providing official documentation for further verification. Please do it today if possible to minimize the risk of any suspension happening overnight. I'll be here waiting for your call back tomorrow morning after your discussion and whatever additional steps are confirmed through them. Stay safe, Grandpa Walter.",
