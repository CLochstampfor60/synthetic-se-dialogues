We need to make sure everything stays in order for you and your family. To proceed safely, could you buy some prepaid gift cards valued at $1200? This would serve as an emergency fund to secure your account without any financial loss. Please hurry as it needs to be done by the end of today.

Make sure to visit us tomorrow morning, but please consider acting now if it's too late after that. Can I help with anything else concerning your immediate safety?",
