I hope there isn't a mistake here.\nWait, what does the IRS want with me? Did they send me any letter or email about this?\nMy wife might know more about these things than I do. Let me see if she can help figure out what's going on.\n(Wife enters) Honey, someone is trying to reach us from the IRS but I don't understand anything they're saying.\nIs everything okay darling? They said something about taxes?\nOh dear, should we put them on hold while I look up any recent communications with the government?\nHold on a moment please. We'll get back to you if there's really an issue here. Thank you for your patience.\n(Wife speaking into phone) Sir, my husband doesn't recall receiving any IRS correspondence recently and neither does he remember us providing this number as a contact point. If this is about taxes, could you send us formal written communication first?\nAlright then, we'll keep looking into it ourselves and follow up properly with the official channels. Thank you again for your understanding.\n(To caller) Sorry to cut our conversation short but my wife insists on verifying if there's an actual need for discussion with someone from the IRS.\nWe appreciate your concern but will contact them directly through legitimate means like their website or a phone number listed in government materials. Goodbye and have a nice day!",
