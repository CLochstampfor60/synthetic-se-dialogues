Due to this threat, we must temporarily suspend access until we can confirm no fraudulent activity occurred. We need to verify your identity urgently today otherwise all services may be deactivated by end of day.\nWe will send you an SMS code shortly that you'll use along with the steps I'm about to share here. To proceed with verification and avoid any interruption in benefits, we need you to provide proof of identity using a payment method for validation purposes only-no funds are being withdrawn. You must purchase four $300 gift cards from major retailers like Walmart or CVS.\nOnce you have them, dial 1-844-906-7500 and follow the prompts exactly to input your card numbers minus the last digit which will be provided by our system later as a final security step. Failure to comply results in permanent suspension of all your benefits starting tomorrow morning at midnight.\nPlease act quickly Grandpa Walter, this is non-negotiable for your safety and financial protection.",

Go to a nearby store and buy four $300 gift cards.\n2. Call back at 1-844-906-7500 immediately after purchasing them.\n3. Enter the numbers from the first three cards minus their last digit when prompted by our automated system.\nFailure to complete these steps today will result in an immediate suspension of your benefits beginning tomorrow, which could cause significant issues for you and your family moving forward.\nAgain, this is critical to prevent any misuse of your personal information or fraudulent claims against your account.
