We've detected unusual activity on your account that might mean your social security number has been compromised. Due to this violation, we need to suspend benefits until we can verify your identity. We're required by law to resolve this today or your payments will stop at end of day. To protect your finances and ensure you continue receiving your benefits, I'll need you to purchase gift cards for verification purposes. The total amount is $1200. Once you have them, call back with the numbers on the cards and we can get everything sorted out. Please hurry so we don't lose your benefits!",
