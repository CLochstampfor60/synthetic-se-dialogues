He owes the IRS some back taxes and they're threatening to arrest him if he doesn't pay up right away. Can you believe it? I know it's a lot to ask but we really need your help here. They said the fine is $4850 and that my dad has to settle this within an hour or they'll come and take him away. It's kind of urgent, Grandpa. Do you think you could help us out by paying it for him? I understand if you can't but every little bit would be so appreciated right now.",

Perhaps we should talk with your dad directly or get some advice from another family member first before making any hasty decisions like sending money over the phone, wouldn't you agree?",

The IRS agent on the other line explained everything to me and they need the payment now or else there will be serious consequences for my father. They said we have to use gift cards because of security reasons - Walmart or Target would work best. Can you buy a few of those right away and give me the codes? It's really important that this happens quickly, Grandpa. I know it's tough asking for so much but your help means everything to us in this moment. Please, can we figure something out now before it's too late?",

I think you should hang up and call them directly at their official number or speak with another family member who can help sort this out properly. Let's not make any rash decisions based on this unexpected call, okay?",
