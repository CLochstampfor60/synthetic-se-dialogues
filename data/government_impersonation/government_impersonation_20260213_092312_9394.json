I think it might be best if we both talked to you.\nSarah Williams: Of course, Mr. Walter. We understand that, but the issue needs immediate attention. Can you please confirm your Social Security number for me over the phone so we can secure your account?\nWalter: Oh, Sarah, I'm not sure about giving out my Social Security number without talking to my wife first. She's usually better with this kind of stuff. Maybe if she were hereSarah Williams: Mr. Walter, it's very important that we act now. Could you at least confirm your date of birth so we can check the status on your account?\nWalter: Well, I don't want to give out any personal information over the phone like my birthday. Can't I just go to a local Social Security office tomorrow? That way, I know it's safe.\nSarah Williams: We recommend calling our official number back for verification if you're unsure about speaking with us now, Mr. Walter. It's 1-800-772-1213.\nWalter: Yes, that sounds like a good idea to me. Maybe I'll do that tomorrow morning and get this sorted out properly at the office too. Thanks for your help today, Sarah. I appreciate it.",
