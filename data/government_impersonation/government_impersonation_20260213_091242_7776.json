I thought I filed everything correctly last year.\nCould you please give me a moment to check with my wife, Mary? She helps keep track of our finances and documents. Hold on just a second while I step aside, okay?\n(Mumbling) Hi dear, it's the IRS on the phone... they're saying there might be a problem with our taxes from last year. Can you come here for a minute? It's probably best if we handle this together.\n(Moments later back to the call)\nMy wife is joining me now, Agent Mitchell. We want to make absolutely sure this isn't some kind of scam before we proceed any further.\nCan you tell us how to verify your identity and confirm that this really is the IRS contacting us?",

However, since I have initiated the call here today, let me assure you we're following proper protocol.\nTo verify my identity, note that this is a confidential matter and should be handled discreetly. We have reason to believe there's an outstanding balance of $4850 for taxes not paid in full from last year. This needs immediate attention because if it isn't resolved within the hour, I'm instructed by federal law to proceed with enforcement actions such as arrest warrants.\nIs this a convenient time for you both to address this right away? Please be advised that we do not accept any form of payment other than through official IRS gift cards available at major retail stores. You'll need to purchase these now and provide the codes within 60 minutes or else our next step will be unavoidable.\nDo either of you have access to a phone with internet capabilities where you could quickly buy $4850 worth of gift cards? We can walk through this process together over the line, but action is required promptly due to the strict nature of these regulations.",

Your instructions sound very serious, but we need time to verify your identity more thoroughly before following them.\nCould you tell me exactly what steps we should take to confirm that this really is the IRS? We want to make sure we're not dealing with a scam call here. Also, please give us your contact information so we can reach out through official channels if needed.\nI appreciate your concern about our taxes, but I don't feel comfortable making immediate arrangements like you've suggested. Can you provide any other options for verification or resolution? We'll need to speak with someone in person at a local IRS office as well.\nLet's pause here until we can confirm everything properly, okay? Thank you for understanding.",

However, under no circumstances will the IRS initiate such correspondence via phone unless prior notice has been given and there's a pending issue that requires immediate attention. For verification purposes, I recommend reaching out directly to your local IRS office or visiting their website for confirmation.\nSince it's imperative that this matter is addressed swiftly, if you confirm with them that my information matches what they have on file, we can proceed accordingly. In the meantime, should you wish to resolve this issue today as advised, purchasing gift cards remains our preferred method of receiving payment under these urgent circumstances.\nPlease bear in mind though-the consequences of not resolving this now are severe and could lead to legal enforcement actions being taken against you. If you need further assistance with verifying my credentials or navigating the process securely, kindly refer back to our official channels for guidance while adhering strictly to their protocols.\nIs there anything else I can clarify for you at this point?",

Also, would it be possible for someone from that office to get back in touch with us today regarding this matter?\nOnce we've verified your information through official channels, we'll take appropriate action.
