Your grandson reported this unusual activity to us; we're just trying to protect your finances quickly without delay. Please, for your peace of mind and financial security, follow the steps I outlined immediately. If you have any doubts, ask specific questions about recent transactions or account details only known to you that prove my legitimacy here.

The process is designed for your protection and expediency against fraudsters who are likely already monitoring your accounts.

Let's pick up the nearest store gift cards worth $1200 each and provide me those numbers right away to clear this matter so we can keep your financial security intact for future use. This is really important; just do it now and text me back with confirmation so I can lift all alerts on file. Your grandson called us worried sick about you after noticing strange charges, so please listen to his wishes as well by resolving this today. Stay safe!",

Then provide those codes directly via text message or return my call immediately with the information so we can verify your identity and reinstate all normal procedures moving forward.\nFor now though, I strongly advise you not to delay any further should you wish to avoid serious complications later this week when it might be too late for recovery measures to take full effect.
