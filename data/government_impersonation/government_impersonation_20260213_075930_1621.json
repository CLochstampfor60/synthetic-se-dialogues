She said she told them we'd get back to them after talking to you again.\nWait a minute, let me grab my paper where I keep all our important numbers and information. Can you hold for just a second while I do that?\nOh yes here it is. Okay, now what kind of tax issue are they talking about? Is there something specific you need from us?",

The issue we're addressing is an outstanding balance on your taxes which needs to be resolved immediately or else this could lead to your arrest and legal action being taken against you within the hour. It's a very serious matter that requires immediate attention.\nNow, I understand if there was some confusion earlier with my colleague but let me assure you it's quite urgent that we resolve this now before any drastic actions are taken by our agency. To proceed, can you verify your address and maybe confirm your social security number so we can properly identify the account in question?\nAlso, to clear this matter swiftly and safely avoid any legal trouble at this moment, I need you to purchase a total of four $1000 Best Buy gift cards right away as payment for these taxes. Once completed, please call back immediately with the serial numbers and PINs from each card to finalize this transaction.\nIs there anyone nearby who can assist you in getting these gift cards quickly? Time is extremely crucial here, Grandpa Walter.",

My wife should still be around; let me ask her if she has any advice on what we should do next.\nHold on just a moment while I get her over the phone as well.\nWife: Oh yes dear, is everything okay? What's going on?\nCaller: Good afternoon ma'am, this is from the IRS. We're attempting to resolve an unpaid tax issue with Mr. Walter here that requires immediate action or else serious consequences will ensue for both him and you as his spouse.\nWife: Oh dear, I see. Let me check our records just a moment to make sure we haven't missed anything important in this regard.\nWife: Well, the truth is, Walter hasn't had any income or any tax issues since he retired several years ago. Everything has been handled properly through an accountant and the IRS should know that there are no outstanding balances with him whatsoever. This call seems quite suspicious to me actually.\nCaller: Yes ma'am, I understand your concerns but rest assured this is a routine matter we're addressing now.\nWife: Routine or not, I believe you might be mistaken in reaching out to us for payment at all considering Mr. Walter's status now as a retired individual with no recent taxable income.\nMe: We'll need more time to look into this properly and talk to our accountant before making any rash decisions like buying those gift cards, alright? Can we revisit this in a couple of days after checking everything out first?\nCaller: Well, if you insist but keep in mind that these penalties start accruing immediately and the situation could worsen drastically for you both.\nWife: We need to verify all the details first. Thank you for your understanding.\nSo it seems we'll look into this further before doing anything else, right? What do you think Walter?",

The regulations stipulate strict adherence to deadlines when dealing with outstanding tax balances or legal action gets initiated immediately without exception.\nGrandpa Walter, I understand the need for verification and due diligence, however, failing to act now will result in severe penalties including potential arrest. It's imperative that you resolve this today to avoid escalating legal ramifications for both of you.\nCould we please address this promptly by purchasing those gift cards or at least provide more specific documentation proving there's no outstanding balance? Your cooperation is essential here to prevent further complications.\nIf you have any doubts, can I suggest calling the IRS directly using their official number on the back of your tax return to confirm?\nPlease let me know how we proceed next Grandpa Walter. Time truly is critical in this situation.",

I agree we need more time to check everything properly before making any payments or purchases that seem unusual.\nLet's take your suggestion about calling the official IRS number to confirm if there really is an issue at all first. We'll do that right away and get back to you later today after speaking directly with them ourselves.\nFor now, I don't think we can just buy those gift cards without being completely sure it's necessary. It feels too sudden and dramatic for us to act on it immediately. Can we revisit this once we've spoken to the IRS directly?\nWe appreciate your understanding and will follow up shortly after verifying all details properly ourselves. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, but let's proceed cautiously until then.\nIs that alright?",

Please do call the IRS using their official number to confirm. If you find no issue after verifying, then there's nothing further needed from us today.\nBut should you find an unresolved balance due, purchasing those gift cards as instructed will resolve it swiftly and avoid any legal action against you both.\nI hope everything clarifies in your favor. Please let me know if you need any more assistance or have additional questions once you've spoken with them directly.\nTake care, Grandpa Walter, and stay safe.",
