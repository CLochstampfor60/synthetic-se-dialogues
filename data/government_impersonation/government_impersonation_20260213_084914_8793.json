Is there a way you could connect me to someone I know there or send an official email about this?",

We're facing a serious breach in security where many individuals' Social Security numbers may have been compromised. That's why it's crucial that only legitimate account holders confirm their identities right away to secure their benefits.\nTo do this, I need you to purchase a gift card for $1200 and provide the code as proof of your current contact information on file with us. This is strictly to protect your funds from being suspended while we investigate further into this matter. Once we have that confirmation, we'll clear everything up immediately.\nIs there any chance I could get that number soon so we can continue helping you? Time's running out for today, Grandpa.",

Can't the SSA send us a letter first instead?\n(Wife speaks off-mic)\nShe said we should not be buying any gift cards for anyone who calls us. Let's look up your number online and call you back properly, okay? We'll find an official way to reach you.\n(returns to phone)\nListen, I'm going to hang up now and talk this over fully with my wife. Maybe later today or tomorrow after we've had a chance to research this and speak directly through their proper channels, alright?\nGoodbye for now.",
