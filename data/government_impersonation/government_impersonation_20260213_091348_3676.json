We're ready to assist however you see fit, but please don't wait too long or your benefits might be suspended until further notice.\nIf you do decide to call Social Security now and speak directly with someone there, they'll likely ask similar questions to verify your identity and discuss how we can secure everything going forward. Just remember, once you've spoken with them, it's crucial that you contact us back here at the SSA as soon as possible so we can resolve this quickly.\nPlease do take care of yourself and stay safe during these uncertain times.
