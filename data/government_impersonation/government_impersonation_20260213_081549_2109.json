Ignoring this can result in legal consequences including possible arrest. We've been trying to contact you via mail but haven't received a response yet.\nTo clear up your situation now, I need you to pay the fine using gift cards. Can you purchase these right away? This must be done within the hour to avoid further action from our enforcement team.\nYou can buy them at any store and give me the codes over the phone once you have them. Let's resolve this quickly before it gets worse. Do you understand what needs to happen, Walter?",

Just want to make sure everything checks out since this is such an urgent matter for us.",

As for your request about sending a check or any other method besides gift cards, unfortunately, that's not an option right now due to our strict protocols. \nRegarding your query about confirming my badge number and department, I assure you that I am Agent Thomas Mitchell from the IRS with Badge #IRS-7734. This information is available on our official website if you wish to verify it yourself.\nLet's resolve this efficiently so we can prevent further issues for you. Please proceed with purchasing the gift cards now. Remember, time is of the essence here.",

Just want to make sure every base is covered.",
