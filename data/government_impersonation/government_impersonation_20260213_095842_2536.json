My hearing isn't as sharp as it used to be, so let's take our time here.\nAre you Walter's grandson or granddaughter? Can you give me a name and maybe your relation just to make sure we're clear on this call?\n(I'm actually conducting research on scam calls. This isn't really a family emergency.)",

There's been some legal issues here and they're saying if we don't resolve it fast, there could be real consequences. Can you help by paying a fine right away to clear things up? It's only $4850 and they want it on gift cards. Do you think you can manage that for me, Grandpa?",

You see, my wife and I live a simple life on our fixed income; we wouldn't be able to manage such expenses. Can you tell me more about this situation? It sounds very serious and urgent, but I need to make sure it's not just someone trying to trick us.\nIf there really is an emergency with one of your family members or friends, they should call directly on the phone number we have for them. It's important that any financial dealings are done carefully. Can you give me a minute to talk this over with my wife? She'll be able to help figure out what's going on here and if there's anything we can do to assist properly.\nLet me hang up now so I can go ask her about this situation, okay? Please don't call back until after I've had time to speak with her. If it is something genuine, she'll know the best way for us to help you out.",
