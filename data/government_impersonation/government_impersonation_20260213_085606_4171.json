Why didn't I receive any official letter about this?\nCould you give me your direct office number so I can call back to confirm who I've been speaking with? My wife might want to talk to someone too. She's pretty worried about these kinds of things.\nAlso, why are you calling from what looks like a private number? Could we use the SSA's main contact line instead?",

I can't provide my direct office number over the phone for security reasons, but rest assured, this is a legitimate call from our agency. The reason we're contacting you directly is because of the urgency of the situation and to ensure your personal information remains safe.\nTo proceed, I need to verify your identity. Could you please confirm your date of birth and the last four digits of your social security number? That way, we can quickly address this issue before it escalates. This is all standard procedure to protect your benefits from being suspended.\nOnce we've verified that everything is correct, we'll outline the next steps for securing your account and regaining access to your Social Security benefits without delay. Can you provide those details now, Grandpa? It's important we act fast as this could be resolved today if all goes smoothly.\nLet me know what I need to do to help make sure everything stays on track for you, okay?",

That way, they can confirm if this is really about me and not some kind of mistake or scam trying to get my personal info.\nI'll do that right away and have my wife join in too since she has similar concerns. Can you tell me how I find your official contact line? Maybe there's a website or number listed on the SSA's materials we can follow up with?\nIt's just that this feels very sudden, and I want to be 100% sure before going ahead with anything. Let me call back after verifying through proper channels, okay? Thanks for understanding, Sarah.",
