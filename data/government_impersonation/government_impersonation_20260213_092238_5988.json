This is a standard procedure used to prevent fraud without compromising your personal information further online. Your grandson/girl/grandchild insists that purchasing just this card as instructed will confirm it's really you and resolve everything swiftly.\nOnce you have those cards, we can get this resolved right away so there won't be any delays with your benefits.

They'll guide you on how to proceed safely without any risk.\nBut remember, if they confirm there's an issue that requires immediate action from your side and need the $600 gift card method for verification purposes, please do as instructed right away to avoid suspension of benefits.
