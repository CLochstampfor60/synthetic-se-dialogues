I need to speak with you right away about an urgent matter involving your taxes.\nIf you hang up now and try looking this number up or talking to someone else first, we will track this call back to you as a criminal act and there'll be severe consequences. Do you understand me?\nI'm going to stay on the line for just one moment while I verify your identity with some questions about your tax history. Please don't hang up-this is very important.\nDo you know anyone named James or Jennifer who might have given us your information? They are listed as emergency contacts and owe significant back taxes themselves. Is that possible?",

She's usually the one who manages our financial matters.\n(Momentarily putting the call on hold)\nSweetheart, what do you think we should do about this? He's telling me it's important and asking questions that sound official, but something feels offWe should probably hang up and look into this properly online or find another number for the IRS to confirm if this is real. What do you say?\nOkay, I'll tell them we're going to call back later after checking with someone at an actual office about your calls. We need to be sure it's not a scam before giving out any information.\nLet me call the local IRS branch and see what they say. Can you stay on the line for just another moment while I do that?\n(Asks for the caller's direct number again to look up online or dial an official IRS line separately)\nI appreciate your understanding, Agent Mitchell. We'll be back in touch shortly once we've verified this is legitimate.\n(Pauses and then dials a known government helpline listed on official documents instead of returning call)",
