It's really important and it will only take a minute or two if you can help immediately.\nActually, Grandpa, let me explain quickly what's happening. The IRS says I need to pay an amount right away or else there could be serious consequences like immediate arrest. They gave me your name as the contact but please don't tell them we spoke about this. It's just between us, okay? Please help me and no one will ever know. Can you do that for me, Grandpa?\nSurely, you can see how urgent this is, right? If I could just get some gift cards with the amount specified, it would clear everything up instantly. The total is $4850. It's all about getting through this quickly so everyone stays out of trouble.
