To get us started on verifying his identity safely, we need you to purchase four $300 gift cards from any major retailer and provide me with the codes immediately upon checkout. This will prove your grandson's identity and prevent unnecessary delays in restoring his benefits. We only have until the end of today to resolve this issue or else it could take weeks to sort out officially through other channels. Please, for everyone's sake, let's proceed right away.",

I can stay on the line with you while you buy the cards if it helps reassure you. Your grandson's benefits are truly at risk of being suspended overnight unless we act now.
