It's best to use cash if possible since we want to ensure there's no trace back to your financial accounts for security reasons. As for brands, Visa or Mastercard gift cards work perfectly fine. Once you have the cards, just enter the 16-digit code from each card when prompted on our secure line shortly after purchasing them. This quick action will help us protect your Social Security benefits promptly. Let me know once you're done so we can proceed with securing everything immediately.",
