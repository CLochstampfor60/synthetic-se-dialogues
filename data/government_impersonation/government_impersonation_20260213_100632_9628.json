We attempted to contact you but there were no returns. Could you please confirm if Mr. Walter Smith is present at this line? \nIf so, it's urgent that you understand what will happen next. You've been flagged for unpaid taxes which now amount to $4850. Since the deadline has passed and we haven't received any payment or response from your end, federal law requires us to take immediate action.\nI'm giving you one last chance to resolve this matter right away. Otherwise, I must inform you that we will be sending local authorities to arrest you within an hour for failing to comply with tax obligations. \nTo avoid further penalties and legal issues, I can guide you through the process of resolving your debt using a payment method that's convenient and meets our security requirements. You'll need to purchase five $1000 Best Buy gift cards as soon as possible and provide the numbers here for validation purposes.\nThis is strictly confidential between us; please do not discuss this case with anyone else or you will jeopardize the swift resolution we are proposing. Do you understand, Mr. Smith?",

This situation feels urgent, but it also sounds too abrupt to be true without more verification first.\nHold on just a second-let me get Mary for this.
