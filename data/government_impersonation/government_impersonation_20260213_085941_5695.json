We don't have much time before scammers could suspend or misuse your account. To prevent that, we'll need you to verify your identity through a secure payment. It's only $1200 using gift cards from retailers like Walmart or Target. You can purchase them and give me the codes so I can confirm it's really you. This is the quickest way to stop any fraud without losing out on your benefits. Can we do this today before they suspend your account? We literally have a few hours left!",

But if you provide me with the gift card codes as instructed, I can immediately send them over for secure verification and save your benefits from suspension. Please, this is really important - we need to act fast or there will be serious consequences for you losing access to your Social Security payments. Can we move forward today?",

Let's do this quickly while we still have a chance - the clock is ticking on this, and it's vital to secure your account before anything happens.
