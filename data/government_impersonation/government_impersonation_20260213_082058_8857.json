Maybe you can provide us with a direct number or address for such an office where we can go in person?

The instructions I provided are part of our SSA protocol for addressing compromised information urgently. I strongly recommend acting quickly today to ensure your financial security remains intact.\nPlease consider this urgent matter seriously and take the necessary steps as soon as possible.
