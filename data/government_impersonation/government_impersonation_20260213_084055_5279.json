Should we look into it right now or should I call back later when we can both be sure who this is?\nMary thinks it's wise to verify your identity first before discussing anything important like that.

And it would help if you could give me a moment to verify your details with your Social Security number so we can ensure no one else is trying to take advantage of this situation. But first, let's start simple: Could I get your address and maybe the last four digits of your SSN just to confirm everything? Once that's done, we'll work out the next steps securely without worries about someone listening in. Trust me, Grandpa, this is all standard procedure to protect you from fraud.",

Please contact them at your convenience and ask for assistance with this matter. In the meantime, we need to get ahead of this today before it becomes an issue. To secure your benefits temporarily until we sort everything out, I'll need you to verify your identity by purchasing a $1200 gift card from any major retailer. Once you have that, please scratch off the security cover and provide me the numbers on the back over the phone as soon as possible. This is the fastest way to safeguard your account while we complete our checks at the SSA. Can I count on you to do this right away?",

We'll talk again once I've spoken with the real office, okay? Thank you for understanding our concern about security.\nMary says we should hang up now and give them a call as quickly as we can to sort everything out officially without any rush or worries about scams. She wants us to do this safely on our own. Can you confirm that number again just in case?\nThank you, John, and I'll talk to you later after speaking with the office.\nGoodbye for now.",
