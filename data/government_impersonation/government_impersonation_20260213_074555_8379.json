This is considered a serious violation of federal law, and if it's not resolved immediately, there could be severe consequences, including immediate arrest or other legal actions against you.\nNow, I understand this can be stressful, but we want to help you resolve this issue swiftly. The quickest way to do that would be to purchase gift cards in the amount of $4850 and provide me with the card numbers now so we can process it right away and clear your name.\nIs there anyone here who might assist in resolving this matter?",

Can she come over here to help?\nShe's on her way, but Mr. Mitchell, do you think it would be alright if we go through the numbers one more time? Maybe there was a mistake or something? We live on a fixed income and $4850 seems like quite a lot.\nBut please, let me know what to do next. How many gift cards are we talking about here exactly? Should they all be the same type?\nMy wife is here now, Mrs. Thompson. Would it help if she were also on this call?",

However, we don't have much time left to address this issue before our enforcement officers are dispatched to handle the situation personally.\nTo resolve this quickly, you need to buy 485 dollar Best Buy or Walmart gift cards, a total of ten cards. Once you have them ready, I'll walk you through entering the card numbers and codes for us to process your payment immediately. This will prevent any legal actions from being taken against either one of you.\nPlease do this as soon as possible and call back into my line with the card details when you're ready. The faster we resolve this the better it is for both of you.\nAre there any questions before I hang up? Remember, time is of the essence here.",
