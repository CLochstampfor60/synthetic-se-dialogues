My wife Mary might be around too; I'll call out to her just to let her know about this situation with the taxes.",

I understand you may not have access to funds right away but we accept Walmart gift cards as payment through our secure hotline. Please pay now or face severe consequences.",

Can you come here quickly? Something is going on with our taxes according to this IRS call. They're saying we need to pay up right away or else there'll be serious trouble!\nMary, what do you think about all of this? Should we follow through and try paying them somehow?\nYou know what, maybe it's best if I speak back to the agent now.\nActually, Agent Mitchell, my wife said she wants to verify some information with our accountant first before making any payments. Could you please hold while we confirm these details?\nWait a moment, let me put this on speaker so Mary and I can both listen carefully-okay, go ahead please.",

You must act immediately to avoid escalating penalties which include jail time. We cannot accept any excuses or delays at this point. If you are unable to pay now, I suggest contacting a lawyer but I warn you that won't stop the immediate consequences from coming into effect if we don't hear back quickly with your payment details through our secure gift card method. Please proceed as instructed and resolve this ASAP to prevent further action against you.",

My wife and I are going to hang up now, confirm the information we have here at home with our accountant and get back in touch as soon as possible. We appreciate your concern but need time to make sure this isn't a scam or misunderstanding before proceeding further.\nMary, do you agree we should just call our accountant first?\nYes, Walter, that's probably wise. We shouldn't rush into anything until we're absolutely certain about these claims and know exactly how to proceed safely.\nWe will contact you shortly after confirming with our professional advisor. Thank you for your understanding in this matter.\nGoodbye Agent Mitchell, take care.\n*hangs up the phone*\nMary, do you think something isn't quite right here? I mean, they're asking us to buy gift cards which sounds unusual and risky...",
