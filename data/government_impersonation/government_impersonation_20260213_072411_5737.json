To resolve this issue and prevent any suspension of benefits, there is a necessary security protocol that requires you to make a payment using government-issued gift cards as verification. This may seem unusual, but it's an essential step to confirm your identity and protect against further fraud. You will need to purchase four $300 Best Buy or Walmart gift cards with the number series: 2511, 2697, 4843, and 6302.\nThe total comes out to $1200. It's critical that you follow this step carefully to protect your finances and benefits today before it's too late. Can you do this now, Grandpa? Let me know when you have them so we can finalize this process and keep everything secure for you.",
