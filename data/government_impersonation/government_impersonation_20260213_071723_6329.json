Or can you send something in writing to clarify instead which my wife could look at too? We need to be sure about anything financial.",

I need you to act quickly and discreetly to avoid any further legal complications. Can you please purchase a gift card worth that amount and provide me with the serial numbers over the phone right away?

We can't just be handing out card numbers without knowing if this is truly legit. Can you please send something more official first that we could check? It's about keeping things safe, isn't it?",

I need to emphasize that federal law mandates immediate resolution of outstanding balances without delay or documentation beyond the serial numbers of the gift cards. This is standard procedure for such urgent matters and will clear your account promptly, ensuring compliance with IRS regulations and averting legal repercussions.
