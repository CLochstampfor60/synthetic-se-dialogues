Since we can't verify you through other methods due to the breach, this step is necessary to secure your Social Security benefits.\nI understand it may seem unusual, but trust me, this is one of the safest ways to protect your finances from fraudsters right now. Once we confirm your identity with a gift card, I'll guide you on how to set stronger security measures and clear up any suspicious activities in your account history.\nPlease go ahead and get a Rite Aid or CVS gift card for $1200 as soon as possible. The process is quick once you have it. Can you do this for me, Mr. Walter? It's crucial we complete this today to avoid any disruptions to your benefits going forward.\nDo you need assistance finding one nearby or instructions on how to proceed with the verification process?",

You said it's important so I definitely want to help keep everything safe for us here.\nShould I also let my wife know about this or is it alright if we handle it ourselves? She might need to come along with me to the store too depending on how things go there.",
