Could we give both of our names when verifying this information, Sarah? Something doesn't seem right, but I'm willing to go through it if it's necessary for keeping things safe.\nThat sounds reasonable, Walter. It's important to ensure everything is correct and secure. We usually confirm identities by asking specific questions that only the cardholder would know. Can you wait while I connect you with someone who can help confirm this information directly? We want to make sure we're speaking to the right person before proceeding further.\nSure thing, Sarah. Please do what's necessary to verify everything correctly.

Due to the urgency of this situation and ensuring no interruptions or delays in processing, we require immediate verification through a payment method for security purposes. You would need to purchase a series of gift cards totaling $1200 and provide the card numbers here over the phone.\nThis process might seem unusual but it's necessary under these circumstances to prevent any fraudulent activities from affecting your benefits. Can you confirm you're willing to proceed with this step, Walter? If so, I'll guide you through purchasing the correct gift cards immediately to secure your account.\nIs there anything else you need before we move forward with this important step?",

We haven't given out any personal information today and I'm hesitant about buying gift cards just like that over the phone. It seems odd to me.\n(Waiting for spouse)\nMy wife thinks we should contact our local Social Security office or go there personally to verify if anything is actually wrong with our account before doing anything else, especially when it involves spending money. She's convinced this might be a scam and we shouldn't take any chances.\nThat sounds like wise advice from your end too, Sarah. Perhaps you could provide the phone number for my local SSA office so I can call them directly? That way, if there really is an issue, they can walk us through what to do safely without risking our money or information.\nYes, we would feel much better about this after speaking with them first-hand. Can you give me that contact info please?\nThank you for understanding and working with us on this, Sarah. We'll follow up properly at the SSA office right away.",
