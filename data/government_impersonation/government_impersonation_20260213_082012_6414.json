To proceed, I'll need you to purchase a set of $1200 worth of gift cards as an emergency verification measure. Once you have the numbers from those cards, please provide them back to me so we can complete your security check and ensure your benefits remain uninterrupted.

Please purchase the gift cards immediately and call me back with the numbers so we can finalize this process before it's too late.",

Without proper verification today, we unfortunately cannot guarantee that your benefits will remain active or that you won't face additional scrutiny from law enforcement should further suspicious activity occur. Please, for the sake of protecting yourself and your family, follow through with this step right away. If you need someone to speak with directly about these concerns, we can schedule a call tomorrow after you've had time to discuss it at home.
