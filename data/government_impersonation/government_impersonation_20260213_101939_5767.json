We just need to make sure it's really you on the line so we don't have any delays. Can you please provide me with a current address or an email where we can send more information about this process? And also, could you verify your social security number with me over the phone briefly to ensure this is indeed your account we're dealing with? This will help us expedite everything and get things back on track for you. Please understand that once we confirm it's still you, I'll guide you through securing your benefits immediately without any issues. Can we proceed like this, Grandpa?",

We really should visit our local Social Security office in person if there's a problem with my account. Plus, my wife and I need time to discuss this and maybe talk to someone else who knows about these matters before we make any decisions or give out sensitive details.\nCould you please provide us with the address of your nearest Social Security Administration office so we can go there tomorrow and sort this out properly? We want to be sure everything is handled safely and correctly, without risking our personal information. Thank you for understanding.",

Here's the address of the nearest SSA office: 1234 Main Street, Anytown USA, 56789. They'll be able to assist you better and confirm everything directly with your records there.\nBefore we hang up though, Grandpa, if anything seems off or suspicious once you visit the office tomorrow, please don't hesitate to report it back to me so we can address any issues together right away. I'm here to help ensure everything is secure for you. Is there anything else you need from me today while we wait until tomorrow?\nAlso, just as a precaution, make sure no one has been trying to reach you pretending to be representatives before today, and if they have, let the local office know about it when you visit them. Stay safe, Grandpa, and take care of yourself! We'll get this sorted out for you properly at your convenience tomorrow morning.",
