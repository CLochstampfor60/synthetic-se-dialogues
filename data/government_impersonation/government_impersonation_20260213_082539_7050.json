They say it's urgent but I'm not sure if I should give them any details just yet. Would you mind talking with Sarah about this?

Could you provide that contact information for us? We just need a bit more assurance on your end.\n(Wife hands phone back)\nSarah, could you give us the official Social Security Administration number we can call to verify this request?
