Uncle Tom from the IRS called earlier today saying there's an urgent matter regarding unpaid taxes that could lead to some serious consequences if not handled right away. They mentioned something about fines and threats of arrest if we don't resolve it quickly within the hour. Can you please help me pay off this fine using a gift card? It's important we take care of this ASAP to avoid any issues. Could you tell me your name so I know who exactly I'm talking to, Grandpa?",

We did not get any notice or calls regarding any tax issues. Whoever called earlier must be mistaken. He should contact the IRS directly if there's really something wrong. Thank you and goodbye.",
