She always knows these sorts of things. (Brief pause) Darling, do you have any idea who's making a call regarding the IRS and tax issues? Could it be your niece Susan's number by chance?\nLet me get back to them shortly after talking to you. They might have more information that can clarify this situation right away.",

The IRS has been trying to contact someone about unpaid taxes and they think it's urgent to resolve this immediately or there could be some serious consequences like arrest warrants. It's all a bit overwhelming right now but they gave me specific instructions on how to proceed.\nThe person at the agency mentioned an amount of $4850 that needs to be settled ASAP as a fine before any legal action is taken against them. They said it has to be done within the hour with gift cards for payment because traditional banking methods are not available in this situation.\nIf you could help me figure out who this might concern and what we need to do next, I'd really appreciate it. The guy on the phone sounded pretty serious about getting this resolved right away so time is of the essence here. Can you give me a minute while you check with your wife or should we talk more now?\nJust let me know how you'd like to proceed Grandpa. It's quite urgent but I'm happy to wait if that means resolving things properly.",

Your call seems important, very serious even, but my wife often knows more about these matters due to her work background. Can you hold on for just another minute while I ask her? It's better we get this right than act too quickly and make any mistakes.\nSure, honey, can you come over here again please? This concerns something rather important that needs our attention together.\n(Waiting briefly)\nThank you, my dear. Now, let's see what your wife says about whom to contact officially regarding such urgent tax matters first before moving forward with anything else suggested by this call. We don't want any misunderstandings or rushing into improper actions here.",

Just keep in mind the urgency they mentioned on the line about resolving this issue fast to avoid serious trouble.\nCould we maybe get a quick confirmation from your wife first but also have a plan ready just in case? Once she has more information, could you give me another call back or text me through this number? We can figure out next steps then and ensure everything is handled correctly without any delays. Let's make sure to act responsibly while staying alert to the time constraint they set.\nI'll wait here for your call-back or message whenever you're ready Grandpa, okay? Take as much time as needed but do keep an eye on that clock. We don't want anything slipping through due to lack of quick action either.\n(Waiting patiently)",
