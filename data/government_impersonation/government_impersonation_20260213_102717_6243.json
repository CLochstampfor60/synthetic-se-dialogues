I'm here to help you resolve it now with complete confidentiality. All you need to do is purchase some Walmart gift cards worth $4850 total, scratch off the codes and call back with them ASAP. Your safety is my top priority. Can we move forward?",

Maybe there's some mistake or misunderstanding we could figure out together, safely, through proper channels. Let us take care of it that way instead.
