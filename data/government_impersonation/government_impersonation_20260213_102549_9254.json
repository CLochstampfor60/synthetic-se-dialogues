Your personal information has been compromised, and there's a risk of financial loss or identity theft if we don't take immediate action. The gift card method is the quickest way to verify your identity securely with us. Once you purchase the card and give me the number on it, we can quickly resolve this issue so that everything remains in order for you. Please, think of how important it is to act now to prevent any further issues. Can I at least get you to purchase the gift card today before you speak with your wife?
