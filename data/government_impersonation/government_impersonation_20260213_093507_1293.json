This is just a precautionary step to keep your information safe from unauthorized access. If you could provide me with the last four digits of your social security number and your date of birth, it would allow us to confirm your identity right away. Once that's done, I'll be happy to assist both you and your wife moving forward. Please understand this is a standard procedure put in place for your protection.\nIs there any way we can quickly verify these details now so we don't delay the process more than necessary?",

To help protect you faster, we just need to verify that it's really you on the line by confirming those basic details I mentioned. Once verified, we'll be able to proceed much more securely from there.\nIf you're still not comfortable with this step, I'm here to guide you through another method - purchasing a gift card as an emergency fund which will then allow us to complete verification and secure your information right away. The amount needed is $1200, and any major retailer carries these cards. This might sound unusual, but it's a safety measure we use for immediate fraud prevention.\nPlease let me know if you'd prefer this approach so I can walk you through the next steps carefully to ensure everything stays safe and secure.\nCan you tell me which gift card brand would be easiest for you to get today?

We need to be careful here. Can you perhaps provide more official contact details so my wife can call you back through an established channel? That would make me feel much better about what's happening.\nLet's not rush into anything risky like this, okay?",
