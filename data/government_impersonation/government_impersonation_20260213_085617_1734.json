There's been an issue with unpaid taxes from last year and the IRS has been trying to reach me but something must have gone wrong because they can't seem to find my address or anything. And now there are warrants out for my arrest if we don't resolve it right away. Can you believe that? I just need a little bit of help to pay off what's owed so everything gets taken care of and no one else gets involved. We really should have this sorted within the hour before they come knocking on our door. Please, Grandpa, can you lend me some money through gift cards or something similar? It'd be a huge relief if we could get it squared away now.",

Can you call them as soon as possible? I'll wait here until you're done verifying everything okay? And hurry back to give me a clear signal so we can fix this right away, please!",
