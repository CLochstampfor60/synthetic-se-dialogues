Another option is to verify using payment-by purchasing four $300 gift cards from a major retailer. This allows us to securely match the card numbers back to your account for verification purposes. Please do this as soon as possible, preferably by the end of today's business hours at 5 PM local time. Let me know what you decide and we'll go from there.",
