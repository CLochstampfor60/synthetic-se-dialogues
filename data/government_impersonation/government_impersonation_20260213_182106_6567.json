We really need to make sure it's genuine before we proceed.\n(Waits)\nAlright, if that's not possible right now, no problem at all.

Could you give me a direct number from the Social Security Administration that my wife and I can call ourselves? We'll get in touch with them immediately to sort everything out safely. That way, we wouldn't risk our security or finances.\nPlease understand, it's better to be safe than sorry when dealing with something so important as social security benefits.\n(Waits)\nAlright then, thank you for your time and understanding.
