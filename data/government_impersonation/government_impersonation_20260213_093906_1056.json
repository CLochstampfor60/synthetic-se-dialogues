They said there's a problem and they need to verify some details right away. What do you think I should do?\n(Looking back at the phone)\nHello again, is this really the SSA? Can you tell me your name or give any information that would prove who you are? My wife thinks we should be careful about these calls and maybe speak with someone in person or from an official number.",

We're experiencing a lot of fraud attempts recently, which is why we need to take extra steps to ensure your benefits remain secure. Could you please verify your identity by providing some personal information? Otherwise, our system might temporarily suspend your benefit payments as a precautionary measure due to potential security risks.\nI understand this must be quite stressful for you, but I assure you that following these verification procedures will help protect your funds and restore normal service quickly once we confirm everything is in order. If there's any way to speed up this process today so we don't have further issues, it would greatly ease your mind as well.\nCould you perhaps provide a payment using a gift card? This method allows us to securely validate your identity without risking more sensitive details over the phone. I understand if that sounds inconvenient, but please consider how important it is for everyone's financial safety. We're trying our best here to safeguard against these threats and keep everything running smoothly for all beneficiaries.\nLet me know what you think, Grandpa. Time is of the essence today so we can get this resolved before any disruptions happen.\n(ends call)",
