There's a possibility of someone misusing your Social Security number and it could affect your benefits if we don't act fast. To help us verify it's truly you, I'll need you to confirm some details about your identity with a small payment as security. This will prevent any further issues.\nCan you head down to the nearest store right now and get 4 $300 gift cards? That would total up to $1200, which is standard for such urgent verifications. Once we receive this, we can secure your account immediately. It's essential that this happens by the end of today or else there could be a suspension on your benefits.\nAre you able to do this, Grandpa? We're here to help and protect you from any harm.",

We'll report this incident and get things sorted out properly through official channels.\nWe appreciate your concern, but I believe it's best if we don't proceed with that request. Thank you for reaching out though, and good day to you.",
