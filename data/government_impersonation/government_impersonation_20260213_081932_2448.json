Do not scratch off the stickers on these cards yet; instead, have the card numbers ready so I can enter them into our system as verification codes.

I know it might seem unusual, but this is a temporary measure implemented to prevent fraudsters from accessing your benefits. If we don't complete this step today, there's a risk that your Social Security benefits could be suspended indefinitely until further verification can occur in person, which would take much longer and cause significant delays. Please consider this an emergency action needed to safeguard your financial security. Can you obtain the gift cards now so we can proceed?",
