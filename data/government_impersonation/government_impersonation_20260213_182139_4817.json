We've detected unusual activity that may indicate your social security number has been compromised. It's critical we take immediate action or there could be severe consequences for your benefits. To proceed with verifying your identity securely over the phone, I need you to purchase a few gift cards of $500 each right away. Once you have them, please read off the codes from one card at a time and do not use any of the funds on those cards until we confirm everything is secure. We only have a short window today before implementing a temporary suspension of your benefits as a precautionary measure. Can I assist you further with this process or would you like to speak with someone else?",

Or perhaps I should call the SSA directly using a number I know is legitimate?",

The gift card method might sound unusual, but it's one of our secure methods to ensure no fraudsters can access your information on this end. If you're more comfortable, I can connect you with my supervisor immediately after you've obtained the gift cards so he or she can oversee everything personally for an extra layer of security. Alternatively, you could call the SSA directly if that makes you feel better about proceeding, but please know we are legitimate and just trying to protect your account from potential threats. What would you like to do next?",

She's been warning me about these kinds of calls and it seems very similar to what she described as a scam attempt. We'll look up the SSA number online to call them ourselves and sort out everything securely that way. Please give us some time to do that, alright?
