My name is Walter Green and my wife is here too.\nMrs. Green: Hello, who's this?\nAgent Thomas: Hi Mrs. Green, this is Agent Mitchell from the Internal Revenue Service. We're calling about some overdue taxes for Mr. Green. He needs to pay $8,000 immediately or face serious penalties including fines and arrest warrants.\nWalter: Oh my goodness, I didn't know it was that high!\nMrs. Green: Walter, do they say how you can pay them?\nAgent Thomas: We have several options, sir. You can wire money using Western Union, send a cashier's check, or use our secure payment website for credit card payments.\nWalter: What should we do? My wife and I are retired on a fixed incomeMrs. Green: Walter, let's get his information from the IRS website first before sending anything.\nAgent Thomas: Well, sir, time is of the essence here. If you don't pay within 24 hours, it will automatically increase to $10,000 due to interest and penalties. Can we arrange this today?\nWalter: II guess so. But should I go through Western Union like they suggested?\nMrs. Green: Hold on a moment, Walter. Let me look something up online about the IRSAgent Thomas: Ma'am, you don't need to do that. Our representatives are here to help today.\nMrs. Green: Walter, we really shouldn't send anything without verifying this with the real IRS office ourselves first. Can we call them back tomorrow?\nWalter: I suppose that makes senseAgent Thomas: Unfortunately, Mr. Green, if you wait, it will only make things worse for you. Please consider our urgency.\nMrs. Green: We need to think carefully about this and won't be able to rush into anything without checking first.\nWalter: Alright, thanks for your understanding, Agent Mitchell. We'll look into it further and get back to you tomorrow.\nAgent Thomas: I understand, Mr. Green. But please know that time is not on your side here. I wish you the best.\nMrs. Green: Thank you, we will contact you after verifying this information. Goodbye.",
