I'm calling from the SSA because there's been a possible compromise of your personal information and we need to take immediate action to secure your account. We're considering suspending your payments until this is resolved, but with your cooperation today, we can avoid that. Can you tell me your full name so I can verify who I'm speaking with?",

Once you've had a chance to talk with her, give me a quick call back, okay? I'll be waiting here or you can connect us directly if she needs to speak as well. Just make sure to verify my identity by checking the caller ID on your phone - it should show an SSA number and the name of this investigation. We're doing everything we can to protect your benefits and prevent any possible issues from escalating further. Talk with your wife, and then give me a call back at your convenience.",

If you have any doubts or need further assistance, feel free to reach out via their secure channels listed there.
