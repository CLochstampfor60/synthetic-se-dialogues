They say we have to prove our identity right away or else they might suspend my benefits until this clears up. That would cause a real problem for us, you know? So I was wondering if maybe you could help by speaking directly with them on the phone to sort out who did what. Just to make sure everything stays normal and we aren't dealing with any extra red tape down the line.",

Actually, they said there might be a faster way to verify everything if we could show proof of identity with a small payment towards the investigation fund. It's just $1200 and once that clears up, we can get back to normal without any issues. Would it be okay for you to pick up some gift cards from Walmart or Target? That's what they're asking for as a quick method to clear things up today. We don't want this dragging on longer than necessary.",
