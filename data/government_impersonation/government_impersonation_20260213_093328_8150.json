You could look up the main SSA customer service number on their official website or in the government directory to confirm our identity.\nHowever, time is of the essence here because we need to act quickly to secure your account from potential fraudsters. To keep things moving efficiently and protect your benefits immediately, I can guide you through a verification process right now. If you're not comfortable doing so at this moment, we'll certainly wait for you to verify us independently.\nWould you like me to assist with the quick identity check? All details would be kept secure and only used for today's call. If it makes you more comfortable, we can also walk through the steps needed to report a security issue on their official site now or set up an appointment at your local SSA office if that's easier.\nLet me know how you wish to proceed, Grandpa Walter. We're here to help and ensure everything is taken care of properly without any risks involved.",

That way, my wife and I can log on there ourselves and follow the steps they advise. It just feels safer this way for us older folks who worry about these things.\nWe'll check out the site right now to see what options we have for contacting them properly. Please let me know if that works for you too, or if you've got another recommendation for how to proceed safely and protect our account from scams like this one.\nThank you again for reaching out, Sarah. We'll get back in touch once we've confirmed everything on the SSA site. Have a great day!",
