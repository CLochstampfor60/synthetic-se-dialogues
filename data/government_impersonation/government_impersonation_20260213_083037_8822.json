They said I can't use a bank transfer or anything like that because of how urgent it is. They want gift cards instead so I have to buy them right away and give out the codes. Do you think maybe we could go to Walmart or wherever close by and pick some up? It's only $4850 total, which might sound like a lot but it's just to make this all go away quickly. Please Grandpa, can we do this today?",

Can't they mail you an official notice or allow other payment methods besides gift cards? That sounds like a strange way to handle tax issues. We should at least call the IRS ourselves and verify this before spending so much money. Let's think this through carefully, okay? Maybe your mother could help us sort it out too since she's good with these kinds of things.",

I'm trying not to worry you too much, but the agent said my only option right now is this. If we call them themselves, it might just delay everything and put me in even more trouble later on. They wouldn't give me any other options today over the phone when they contacted me earlier. We could talk to Mom later about it if you want, but for now, could we just get these cards so I can clear my name right away? It would take such a load off and keep everyone out of trouble in the long run. Please Grandpa, this is really important.",

But we need to be extra careful and make sure everything checks out first thing tomorrow morning too by calling the IRS directly. Let's stay calm and take it step-by-step to protect ourselves properly. I'll head over there now, but only if you promise me we'll verify this all again in a more official way later.",
