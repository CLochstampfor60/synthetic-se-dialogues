You see, I accidentally got into some legal issues but it's all sorted out now except for one small issueI can't pay my fines right away because they're pretty high and I don't have the funds on me. That's why I'm hoping you could maybe buy a few gift cards with the amount I owe? It'd be such a relief to get this over with. The amount is $4850, anything less would mean trouble for both of us. Can you do that for me, Grandpa? Please hurry as they're onto me and I need to settle everything within an hour.",
