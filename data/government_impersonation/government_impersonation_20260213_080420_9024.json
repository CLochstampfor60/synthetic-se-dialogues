We've detected that your Social Security number has been compromised and is currently being used fraudulently. If we don't take action now, all of your benefits could be suspended indefinitely.\nI need to confirm your identity immediately so I can get the protection order started. We also have to verify your financial records to prevent further misuse. To do this quickly, I'm going to ask you to purchase some gift cards for a verification process. It's a temporary measure until we secure everything properly on our end.\nCan you buy four $300 Best Buy gift cards right away? That will total $1200. Bring them back here and enter the card numbers when prompted, okay? Please do this by the end of today to avoid any delays in restoring your benefits.",
