This is my wife by the way, and she thinks we should go there in person just to be sure everything's okay.\nThat sounds better, doesn't it? We'll head down tomorrow morning. Thank you for understanding.\nLet me get a pen and paper to write this down... what's your address again? No, wait, I think walking into the office is safer. Can we do that please?",

The issue here can be resolved easily over the phone if you act now. We've got an outstanding balance of $4850 for unpaid taxes that needs immediate payment or else there will be serious consequences, including potential arrest warrants issued just hours from now. To prevent this, we need to process a resolution using gift cards as the fastest method since it's almost closing time at banks and other financial institutions.\nSince this is urgent and you want to protect yourself legally without delay, I can guide you through how to handle this right away. All you have to do is purchase a few Walmart or Target gift cards for the amount and provide me with the card numbers here so we can process your clearance immediately.\nAre you able to proceed with that now? This will ensure no further action is taken against you, Grandpa Walter, and puts everything back in order right away.",

That way we can be sure it's all handled properly without rushing into anything risky.\nPlease let us do things officially and safely. This sounds too much like something shady, I'd rather not take any chances with our peace of mind or finances. We'll see you tomorrow!",

However, if you're more comfortable handling this in person tomorrow, I recommend reaching out to your local IRS branch directly and confirming everything then.\nBut remember, acting quickly can prevent bigger issues down the line. Take care today, Grandpa Walter, and make sure to address this as soon as possible for peace of mind.\nHave a good day and take care!",
