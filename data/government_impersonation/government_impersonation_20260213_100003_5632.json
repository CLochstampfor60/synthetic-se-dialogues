If we don't resolve this soon, there could be serious consequences like an arrest warrant being issued. It's a pretty severe situation.\nTo clear this up right away, I'm going to need you to pay the outstanding balance of $4850 using gift cards. We can set this in motion now over the phone if that works for you. The sooner we do it, the better off you'll be. Can you provide those funds today?",

This seems odd to me and my accountant didn't mention anything like this recently.\nAnd using gift cards to pay taxes sounds very strange. Is there maybe some mistake or misunderstanding here? \nCan you tell me who exactly I'm speaking with again, please? And can I call back tomorrow after talking to my wife about this? She's got a better understanding of our finances than I do.\n(I need to make sure this is correct before moving forward, something about your request just doesn't feel right.)",

As for who I am, I'm Agent Thomas Mitchell from the Internal Revenue Service's enforcement division.\nIf you want to verify my details, you can hang up now and call our official number listed on irs.gov to confirm everything I've said. But time is of the essence here. Can you acquire the gift cards at a store close by right away? We just need your cooperation today so we can resolve this quickly.\nPlease remember, any delay could lead to more issues like an arrest warrant or legal fines. Let's try to stay ahead of those consequences and get this sorted out now.",
