My name isn't super important for now; I'm calling from the IRS regarding an urgent matter concerning your recent tax filings or lack thereof.\nCould you verify your identity with me? Just give me some basic information so we know it's really you on this line, okay?\nNow listen closely because this isn't something to delay. There's a significant issue that needs immediate attention: unpaid taxes amounting to $4850. If not resolved today, there could be serious consequences like an arrest warrant being issued.\nDo you understand why I'm reaching out so urgently? We need to resolve this right away by purchasing gift cards in the exact amount and providing me with those numbers now. It's our only option to clear your name quickly without any further complications. Can we proceed, Grandpa?\nPlease hurry, as there isn't much time left before law enforcement takes action.",

Once they're ready, all you need to do is follow the steps I laid out-purchase gift cards for $4850 and give us those numbers right away. That way, you can clear this up without any further trouble.\nPlease make sure it's done today though.

While I can't provide personal contact info over the phone due to security reasons, you can visit the official IRS website or call their main line directly to confirm this matter.

Once you've confirmed everything with them, come back to us immediately to resolve it properly by purchasing gift cards for $4850 and giving those numbers over the phone.\nLet's make sure we're handling this correctly but also swiftly to avoid any unnecessary stress or complications from law enforcement getting involved.\nIs there anything else I can assist you with while you verify this information?",
