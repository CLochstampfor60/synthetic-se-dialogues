The unusual activity involves multiple unauthorized attempts to use your SSN which could put you both at risk of identity theft or fraud. It's crucial that we verify your identity right away so we can secure your records and prevent any further issues.\nTo do this, we need you to purchase four $300 gift cards from a major retailer like Walmart or Target. Once you have them, call back with the 19-digit code on each card. This will allow us to quickly verify that it's really you making the call and not someone else accessing your information fraudulently.\nCan you do this by end of day? Failing to act now could result in serious consequences for your benefits. I know it sounds urgent, but it's necessary to protect against potential identity theft and ensure your Social Security is secure.",
