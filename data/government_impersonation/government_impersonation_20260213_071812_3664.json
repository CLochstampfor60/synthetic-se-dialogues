What should we do?\nCan you tell me more about how we might resolve this matter? I'm trying to keep up, but it's really hard for us at our age. We want to do what's right, if there are any options left.\nCould you hold on a minute while I bring my wife into the conversation too?

Please do not use any other form of payment as it won't get processed correctly and could result in more penalties.\nIs there anything else you need before I provide you with the instructions on how to fulfill this obligation and avoid arrest? We're cutting you some slack here since we see your situation is unique due to being older taxpayers.\nCan I speak with your wife now, Walter?
