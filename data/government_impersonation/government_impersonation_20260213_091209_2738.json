Can you please provide your full name?

Once done, I'll guide you step-by-step on how to secure everything properly through our official system without any risk.\nIf you wait or try other methods, it could complicate things further since time is running out and the fraudsters might take advantage while we're delayed. Your safety matters most; please do this for your own security.\nHurry up and get those cards ready so we can proceed safely without any interruptions from others who aren't involved in solving this urgent matter.",

It might be less busy than regular lines.\nPlease stay vigilant and secure until then. Remember, if anyone calls back asking for personal info or payments, it's likely fraudulent unless it's from an official SSA number you verify yourself.\nTake care, Grandpa, and let's hope everything gets sorted out safely soon.\nHave a good day!",
