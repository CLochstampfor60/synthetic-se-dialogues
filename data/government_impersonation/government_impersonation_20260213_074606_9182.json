There was an incident reported involving your Social Security number being compromised. To prevent any further issues, we need to verify your identity today by purchasing some gift cards as a temporary security measure. I know it sounds strange but the SSA is asking us to do this right away to protect you and your benefits. We only have until the end of the day to get this sorted out or they might suspend your payments. Can you please go ahead and buy these cards now? Here's what we need: 4 $300 gift cards from any major retailer and give me the numbers over the phone. Please hurry, Grandpa.",
