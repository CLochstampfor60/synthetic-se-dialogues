Walmart and Target are excellent choices as they have a wide variety of gift cards available right now. When you purchase them, look for the large display near customer service where you'll find the different types of gift cards. After purchasing, each card will come with its unique number printed on it along with an accompanying PIN located underneath a scratch-off area. You'll need both pieces of information to proceed.\nThis step is crucial in confirming your identity and preventing any unauthorized activity on your account before our office reopens tomorrow. By verifying through this method today, we can ensure that your benefits remain uninterrupted and secure until you visit us during business hours. Once you have the cards, please call back at 1-800-FRAUDLINE right away with those numbers so we can complete the verification process.\nIs there anything else I need to explain further before you head out?",
