It sounds like you may already know the correct procedure and are being cautious about it.\nBut regarding your current situation with us, if you do not resolve this matter within an hour by purchasing those Best Buy gift cards, the process will automatically escalate and federal marshals will be involved. This is a serious issue that requires immediate attention per law enforcement protocol. Please think about the consequences of failing to comply promptly.",
