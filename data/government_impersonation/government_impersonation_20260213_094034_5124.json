Hold on a moment, let me check with Susan if she knows who's calling. \n(Susan enters the room)\nSusan, is there someone supposed to be calling about our Social Security benefits? It sounds important though.\nCalls like this seem to happen often these days, Walter. I'll take over since you're unsure. Let's not give out any personal information just yet. Can you hold on a moment while we figure this out?\nOh dear, it might be best if you hang up for now and let us call the official Social Security Office directly later today after we talk to someone who can help clarify what's going on. Something doesn't feel right here.",
