To clarify:\n- Your grandfather's account shows unpaid taxes from several years ago which have accumulated penalties and interest.\n- The reason direct contact is being made now without prior notice is because standard procedures aren't fast enough given the seriousness of delinquency.\n- Gift cards are used as a secure method to prevent loss of funds during transfer, especially over the phone or online where scams are common.\n- I can't provide official documents or formal links immediately due to the urgency and security measures in place. However, if you proceed with purchasing the gift cards as instructed, I will guide you through an immediate resolution process which includes verifying payment details securely.\nPlease understand that delays could result in legal action against your grandfather, including arrest warrants being issued.
