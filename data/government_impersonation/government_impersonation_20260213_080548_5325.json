You still have your old tax records at home, correct? We need the details from last year to clear this up right away.\nCan you please head to the nearest store and purchase four $1000 Best Buy gift cards? This will show we're taking immediate action on this matter. They'll be safe until I can arrange a secure pickup or delivery for them soon after.

There's too much risk involved if you delay any longer. I'm doing my best to keep things out of sight and under control, but time is running short.
