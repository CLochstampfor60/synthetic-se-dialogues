But hold on, shouldn't the IRS be sending letters first if there was a problem?\nWait a minute, why are you asking for money or bank details? This sounds strange. Can I talk to someone else at the IRS instead? Let me check something online.\nI think we should end this call and I'll look up the real number for the IRS just in case. Thank you though, I appreciate your concern but let's make sure everything is okay with my records before doing anything.\nHang on, Carol (my wife) will be here soon, maybe she can help figure out if this is legit too.",

This isn't about getting your information or any bank details - we've already resolved that issue internally and it's urgent you act now to avoid serious trouble. Your name Walter Davis, correct? We found an outstanding balance of $4850 for unpaid taxes from last year which needs immediate attention before local law enforcement gets involved. I need you to purchase a few Best Buy or Walmart gift cards totaling the exact amount right away and give me the codes so we can resolve this case today.\nPlease understand, failure to comply will result in an immediate arrest warrant being issued due to non-payment of taxes under federal law. This isn't something that can wait another hour or day. Your cooperation now is crucial for your peace of mind moving forward. Can you do that for me Grandpa?",

Honey, can you come here a second please?\nCarol, there's someone on the phone saying it's IRS about unpaid taxes from last year and they want me to buy gift cards. Does that sound real to you? I don't think soWe should definitely look up the official IRS number and call them directly instead of doing what this person is asking us to do. They could be scammers trying to take advantage of us.\nLet's hang up now and deal with this properly, okay? Thank you for coming in Carol, that was very smart of you.",
