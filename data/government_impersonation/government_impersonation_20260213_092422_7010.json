You just need to buy some gift cards right now and give me the codes so I can pay off what I owe the IRS. It's $4850 in total. Can you do that for me? Please, Grandpa, this is urgent.\nYou're my only hope here. I'm begging you to help me get out of this mess.\nI need you to go now and buy some Amazon gift cards, then call me back with the codes so I can pay what I owe.
