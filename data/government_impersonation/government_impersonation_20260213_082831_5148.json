It involves some serious trouble and legal issues, but it's all on my end-nothing to worry about regarding you. But your help would be absolutely crucial because I need to pay off a fine urgently or else the IRS will come after me tonight if I don't settle this debt immediately. Can you help me with that, Grandpa? It's $4850 and needs to be settled within an hour from now. Do you think you can do that for me?",
