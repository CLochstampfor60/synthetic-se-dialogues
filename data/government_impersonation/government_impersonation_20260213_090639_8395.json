Someone from our agency contacted me about some unusual activity linked to your Social Security number. This could affect your benefits if we don't resolve this today. I'm here on behalf of the SSA office trying to help you secure your information before it's too late. Can you confirm that's your number they mentioned? It starts with 123-45...",

Why don't we both call this SSA office back at their main public number to verify who you are and what's up? The last thing I want is for someone to get hold of private info. Can you give me that official number, please? And maybe help me with it if my hands aren't steady enough today?",

To ensure this is really your number they're referring to, there's a quick confirmation process we can do through our secure line here. But before that, to proceed with the verification, could you please confirm an address on file for us? It's just to make sure it's you on the other end and not someone else trying to cause trouble. Once I verify this, we'll securely continue from there without worrying about anyone listening in or anything like that. Can you give me your last known address with us so we can move forward? Don't worry; everything will be safe and secure here. Just need a few details now to protect you properly.",

It's just safer that way for everyone involved, don't you agree? Here's what I want to do: I'm going to hang up now and look up their number from their official website. Then I'll give them a call myself to see if there really is an issue with my Social Security account or anything else they need help resolving. That way we can be 100% sure it's the right people calling me back, okay? Please understand why I have to do this. Thanks for your understanding and patience.",
