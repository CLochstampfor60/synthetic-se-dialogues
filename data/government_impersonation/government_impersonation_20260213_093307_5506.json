I'm here to help resolve this quickly and protect your benefits now. To proceed with verifying through gift cards is a standard protocol and will ensure everything remains secure under our watch. If you're still hesitant, I can put you on hold briefly while you confirm our legitimacy elsewhere. But remember, time is of the essence for resolving this breach and protecting your account.",
