Now they're saying it's urgent and if I don't pay right away, there could be serious consequences. But here's the tricky part: I'm not in a position to cover this myself anytime soon. That's where you come in, Grandpa. Could you maybe help me out by getting some gift cards? It would really mean the world to me and it wouldn't take care of the whole thing-just enough until I get back on my feet and can sort things out properly.",

Can we talk a bit more later when she's around? Maybe it would be better if someone from the IRS called directly to confirm things first too, don't you think?",
