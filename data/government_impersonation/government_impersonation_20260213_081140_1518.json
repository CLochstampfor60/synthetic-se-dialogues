The amount is $4850. I know that sounds like a lot, but using gift cards is actually one way to do it quickly and securely without setting off red flags. Would you be able to get some Best Buy or Walmart gift cards for me? It'll save us both time and stress. We just need to make this payment within the hour to avoid any legal trouble. Can we handle that, Grandpa?",

She's been helping us manage everything for years now. We're not too familiar with gift cards and transferring money like that. It sounds a bit complicated for us at our age, you see? Maybe it would be best if we visit the IRS ourselves or call them back during regular hours to sort this out properly? Can I do that instead of using these gift cards right now?",

If you don't pay within an hour, my hands are tied and I can't stop them from coming after you. The process with Best Buy or Walmart gift cards saves us both a lot of hassle right now. Why don't you let your accountant know what's going on? She can help you find the cards if you're not comfortable doing it yourself. But remember, time is very short here, Grandpa. Can we do this for me please? It's really urgent and I need to make sure everything goes smoothly so that nobody gets hurt in all of this.",

Let me discuss it with my wife first and perhaps we can find a way to get the help of our accountant sooner than later too. We'll aim to make this right as quickly as possible while ensuring we're on safe ground. Please give us just a bit more time, alright?",

Can I at least have your word that you'll get the gift cards ready and call me back within the hour? It's really important we resolve this quickly or else it could escalate very rapidly. Please promise me you'll take care of it right away, Grandpa. You know how serious these things can become if ignored.",
