Listen, Grandpa, something bad happened and the police are involved but I really don't want them to take me away. Can you please help me? I owe some money to the IRS for taxes and they said if I don't pay up right now, they'll arrest me within an hour. It's a lot of pressure, Grandpa.\nI know it sounds crazy but you're my only hope here. The amount is $4850 and the person at the IRS told me that buying gift cards would work as payment. Please, can you do this for me? They're giving me until the end of the hour to get this done or they'll come after me for sure.\nPlease, Grandpa, I'm begging you, help me out here.",

Are you positive this is the right thing to do? And where are you exactly that they can't reach you by your own phone?\nStill, if it means avoiding trouble and protecting my grandson, I'll try and assist in some way. But how should I proceed with these gift cards? Should I just buy them anywhere near me or do I need specific ones?\nCan you give me a moment to talk this over with my wife? She's right here with me. Maybe she has some ideas too since I'm not as savvy with these things anymore.\nI'll go get her now, hold on.\nHoney, James is in trouble and needs us; he'll explain more when we're back on the call. Can you help us figure this out?",
