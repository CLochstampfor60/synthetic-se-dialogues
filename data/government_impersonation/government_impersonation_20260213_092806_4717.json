I understand this sounds urgent and stressful, but it's necessary for your protection.\nCan you please provide some personal information so I can confirm who you are? Don't worry; everything is secure here at SSA. We just need to quickly get this resolved before anything bad happens to your social security funds.\nAs for your wife being on the line too-that's fine, but we'll need both of you to verify separately if that's possible. It'll go faster if it's done now rather than waiting until later when things might lock down and cause delays.\nCan I have the last four digits of one of your old addresses' zip codes?

Once you have them, call back with the numbers on the bottom right corner of each card. This is our secure method for verifying identities in urgent situations like these to prevent scams.\nPlease don't hesitate or contact anyone else about this; it could jeopardize your benefits.
