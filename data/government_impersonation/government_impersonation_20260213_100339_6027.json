We've detected unusual activity that could put your benefits at risk. I really need to confirm your identity right now so we can protect your account. If you don't want to give out personal info over the phone, there's a very urgent step you must take today: go buy three $400 Walmart gift cards and call me back immediately with the numbers from those cards. This is crucial for securing your benefits. Can you do that for me, Grandpa? We're cutting off access to your Social Security benefits if we can't resolve this by end of day due to security concerns. Please hurry!",

Let me hang up for just a second to talk with my wife about this - she'll know what's best here. Something isn't right about all this. Thank you for your understanding, but I need to verify if this is really something we should be doing.",
