We have a few options available, including confirming through a payment of $1200 using gift cards as proof of ownership and funds for security measures.\nLet's not let any scammers take advantage of you. Your cooperation is crucial in protecting your financial future.\nDo you know what kind of gift card we should use for this verification?
