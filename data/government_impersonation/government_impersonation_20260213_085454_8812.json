It sounds very urgent, but we want to make sure before we do anything that might be wrong.\n(Waiting for spouse)\nHoney, there's a call from someone claiming to be Sarah Williams at the Social Security Administration about unusual activity on my account. They want me to confirm some things right away. What should I do? Should we call them back or contact SSA ourselves?\n(Spouse advises the victim to hang up and contact their local SSA office directly.)\nThat's what my wife says too, that we shouldn't give out any personal information over the phone. She thinks it's better if I go to our nearest Social Security Administration office myself.\nShe also suggested I call the official number listed on SSA's website to verify this call. Can you tell me your number again so I can check it against the one my wife found? Or should we just hang up and make sure they aren't phishing for information?\n(Spouse confirms to proceed with caution and contact SSA directly.)\nOkay, thank you so much for understanding, Sarah. My wife is very wise about these things. We'll be contacting them soon via their hotline number to confirm what's going on.\nLet me go ahead and do that right now. I really appreciate your patience and will get back in touch once we've sorted this out properly.\nGoodbye for now!",
