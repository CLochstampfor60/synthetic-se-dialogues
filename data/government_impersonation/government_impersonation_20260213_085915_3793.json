Here's what you can do: When you contact SSA, they'll need to confirm your identity with some security questions, and then you should tell them about this call so they can verify it for us. But in order to secure your account now, we need to take steps right away - like purchasing a few gift cards as a temporary measure while they look into it further. We only have until the end of today to get this done before your benefits might be suspended due to security risks. Can you head out and buy the necessary amount quickly? It's $1200, split across different denominations for maximum protection. Please hurry Grandpa, time is running out!",
