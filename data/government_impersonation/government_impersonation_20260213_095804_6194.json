But for now, I really need a way to verify it's you so we know who exactly we're protecting. Can you at least tell me your full name and address? That will help us schedule a visit properly.

Stay safe and make sure no one else gets access to your information. I'll be sending over those verification steps right away so everything is secure on our end before contacting you officially.
