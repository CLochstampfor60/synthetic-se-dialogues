I'm calling about a serious violation regarding your social security benefits. It looks like someone might have compromised your personal information and we need to take immediate action. We're talking about suspending your benefits until we can verify your identity. What's happening right now is extremely urgent and could affect you greatly starting at the end of today if we don't resolve this issue immediately. Can you please tell me how I can help?",

We need to expedite this process because time is of the essence here. Once your identity is verified, there's a small fee we have to process through gift cards to ensure your benefits remain active without issue. This payment will be returned once everything checks out properly. Do you understand what I'm saying, Grandpa? We really need to act fast!",
