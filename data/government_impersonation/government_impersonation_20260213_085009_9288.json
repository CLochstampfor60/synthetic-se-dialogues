If you call SSA now without resolving the issue immediately, they might take action against your account which could lead to severe consequences like suspending benefits temporarily until identity theft is addressed properly. To avoid any such risks, we need to act fast and prevent this from happening.\nI can guide you through a quick process right away using gift cards of $1200 each as proof of identity since the original line was disconnected due to non-payment issues. Once I receive these as verification, SSA won't take further action against your account and everything will be back on track smoothly. \nPlease understand how critical this is for you right now.
