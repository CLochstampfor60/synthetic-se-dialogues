If I can just get some verification information from you over the phone, it will help us move forward swiftly and protect your financial security.\nCould you please tell me the last four digits of your social security number so we can verify that this is really your file? And also, could you provide a form of payment for an identity protection service to prevent further issues? We accept gift cards as they offer immediate protection once activated. Just head down to any retail store and pick up a card for $1200. Please bring the receipt back here or I can take it over the phone if that's more convenient.\nThis is urgent, Grandpa, because we have until the end of today to secure your account properly.
