Your account has been compromised and needs urgent attention to prevent further issues. If you do not verify immediately, there could be a suspension of benefits which would affect you significantly. We need to act now before it's too late.\nPlease, for your safety and peace of mind, I just need some basic information right away to proceed with our investigation. It's quick and easy-just your full name and last four digits of your Social Security number so we can confirm everything is in order and protect you from any fraudulent activity.\nIf this isn't an emergency procedure, why would I be calling about it urgently? Please, Grandpa, let's get through this quickly before things escalate.",

If this is truly from Social Security, they should have sent a letter or an email to begin with.\nLet's do it their regular way and not your quick fix method which sounds too risky for my peace of mind. My wife will contact them directly through their official number to confirm everything is alright. We'll end the call now because I don't want any scams or breaches affecting us.\nThank you, but we'll proceed cautiously following proper protocols. Goodbye.",
