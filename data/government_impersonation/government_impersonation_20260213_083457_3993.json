Can we verify this somehow first perhaps? Maybe speaking with a real tax advisor or calling the IRS directly at their number, not just relying on this call?",

The reason no other communication was sent is that these are emergency circumstances and we're expediting things from our end. If you call the IRS directly using a public number, they won't be able to assist as quickly because of privacy laws. But with me on this line now, I can walk you through every step securely. All you need to do is buy those gift cards right away, and we'll sort everything out from there. It's really important that this gets done within the hour though, or else things could escalate very quickly. Can I count on you to handle this for us?",

Could you give me a bit more time to talk it over and perhaps look up official IRS contact information ourselves? That way we can be fully informed and not miss out on proper verification steps.",
