He always checks his mail at the door first thing though for any important letters or notices. Wait a minute, let me ask him if he noticed anything.\n(Walter comes on the line)\nHello again, this is Sarah from SSA. Is everything alright with your Social Security account today?\nWalter: Well, I haven't had any issues and checked my mail at the door like usual. What seems to be going on exactly? \nSarah: That's good to hear. We've seen a number of attempts by fraudsters trying to gain access to personal accounts across the country which is why we're reaching out proactively. If you notice anything unusual or receive any unexpected calls about your benefits, please don't hesitate to contact us immediately.\nWalter: I see, well we'll be cautious and let you know if something comes up. Thanks for the heads-up Sarah.\nSarah: Absolutely, take care Walter and stay vigilant. We're here to help keep you secure.",

To prevent any further misuse of your information and protect your benefits, I'm going to need Grandpa to verify his identity with a small processing fee via gift cards. This will lock down the account temporarily while we confirm it's you on the line.\nWalter needs to buy $1200 worth using major retailers' cards like Walmart or Target. Once he has them in hand, he can read off the numbers and codes here so our team can process this immediately. We only have until end of day today to complete this before we suspend his benefits for everyone's protection.\nIs that something Walter feels comfortable doing now?",
