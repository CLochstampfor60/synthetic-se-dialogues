They might know how to handle something like this and they live closer than I do, right?\nBut really, Grandpa Harold, time is running out for me here.

Maybe [pause] your neighbor Mr. Jenkins who has always been kind and helpful?\n\nWhatever way works, please hurry since this is really pressing on me right now.

The main thing is getting out of here as soon as possible before my case goes to court.\n\nThanks again for all your efforts and support in this difficult situation, Grandpa.
